User: A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity. If there were 50 people at the next pick-up point, how many people could not take the bus because it was full?
Response: At the first pick-up point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity, a total of 3/5*80 = 48. The available seats in the bus after the first pick up point is 80-48 = 32. If there were 50 people in the second pick-up station, and only 32 sits were available, the number of people who did not take the bus because it was full is 50-32=18. Therefore the answer is 18
