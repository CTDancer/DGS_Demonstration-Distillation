previous demo: User: Passage: "Iwasaki's careful respect for the Long Beach program and its lawyers earned him the political capital he needed to complete his takeover in a matter of weeks. "The Long Beach program had strong support in the community so in a situation like that, one has to recognize that it's not like a takeover where I have all the answers and I know best," Iwasaki said. "The people in the community who are working there have the contacts and the knowledge that will allow service to continue." Things have gone less smoothly across town. There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, $6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. "It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone," a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. "There are very few people who come out as the heroes. Personalities got involved when they shouldn't have. Things were said that caused bad feelings and couldn't be unsaid." Iwasaki's merger with the smaller, 48-year-old Long Beach program was friendly and fast, and no one - not even Long Beach board members - lost a job. When it was over, Iwasaki had $1 million more in federal dollars and two new offices. Long Beach clients regained services they had lost years ago when federal budget cuts and dwindling grants reduced the staff of 15 lawyers to five and cut immigration and consumer law programs. Iwasaki said, "[I judged the transition] better than I could have hoped for." "
    Question0: "During federal budget cuts, the number of lawyers were reduced from 15 to how many?"Choices: A. 5 B. 15 C. 1 million D. 6.5 
    Question1: "What is the difference in the ages of the Long Beach and San Fernando Valley programs?"Choices: A. 8 B. 48 years C. 12 years D. 30 year E. 48 F. Weeks G. 36 H. Can not figure out as one has 37 year and other has no age limit I. 36 years J. Eight K. 6.5 years 
    Question2: "In the eyes of the public interest community, was Dudovitz's hostile takeover well-handled?"Choices: A. Handled Well B. 15 C. Not handled well D. Struggle E. 5 F. No G. Yes H. 6.5 I. Smooth J. 1 million 
    Question3: "How many people were fired in order for Long Beach clients to regain services?"Choices: A. One B. 15 C. $1 million D. 10 E. $7.5 million F. 1 G. No one H. 0 I. $6.5 million 
    Question4: "How long was the Long Beach Program been in operation?"Choices: A. 48 years B. 30 year C. 8 years D. 36 years E. Eight F. 2 weeks G. 6.5 years

User: Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said. By contrast, European firms will spend $150 million this year on electronic security, and are expected to spend $1 billion by 1992. Already many foreign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers, conference speakers reported. Still, encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy. One expert, whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldn't be named or quoted, said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers, for example, doubling as foreign spies. Moreover, he said, technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they've been "erased" from a computer's memory. He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read. No personal computer, not even the one on a chief executive's desk, is safe, this speaker noted. W. Mark Goode, president of Micronyx Inc., a Richardson, Texas, firm that makes computer-security products, provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness, known commonly as glasnost. Under Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Goode said, the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications. He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East. Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company, which hadn't been invited to submit a bid. The Soviets' eavesdropping paid off, however, because they got the contract.  According to the passage, answer all the following multiple-choice questions:
    Question0: "Who did the Soviets contract with to pick up a cargo of crude oil in the Middle East?"  Choices: A. Dubai oil trader B. Israeli Oil Trader C. Swiss D. Iran E. A Swiss oil trader F. Iraqi oil trader G. Country bordering Switzerland H. North Korea 
    Question1: "What is the full name of the man who claimed that the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications?"  Choices: A. Gorbachev B. W. Mark Goode C. Mark Goode D. Oliver North E. Richardson F. Mr. Gorbachev G. Mikhail Gorbachev 
    Question2: "Is the step that foreign banks have begun to apply likely to solve the problem completely?"  Choices: A. Yes B. Impossible C. Maybe 
    Question3: "Are Europeans spending more or less to combat electronic espionage than the U.S.?"Choices: A. About the same B. More C. A lot more D. Less
