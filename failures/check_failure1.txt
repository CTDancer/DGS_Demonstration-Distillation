User: A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity. If there were 50 people at the next pick-up point, how many people could not take the bus because it was full?
Response: 1st pickup: 3/5 * 80 = 48 people on the bus. Seats left: 80 - 48 = 32. 2nd pickup: 50 people. People who couldn't take the bus: 50 - 32 = 18.

User: James takes up dancing for fitness. He loses twice as many calories per hour as he did when he was walking. He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time and he does this 4 times a week. He burned 300 calories an hour walking. How many calories does he lose a week from dancing?
Response: Calorie burn per hour dancing = 2 * 300 = 600 calories. He dances for 2 * 0.5 * 4 = 4 hours per week. Calories burned from dancing = 600 * 4 = 2400 calories.

User: Happy Cattle Ranch is home to 200 cows. Every year, the mother cows have enough calves that the number of cows the rancher owns rises by half the number of cows living on the ranch. In two years, how many cows will the rancher own on Happy Cattle Ranch?

User: Out of the 150 students, 60% are girls and the rest are boys. Only 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs. How many of the boys did not join varsity clubs?
Response: Number of boys = 40% of 150 = 60 boys. Boys who joined varsity clubs: (1/3) * 60 = 20. Boys who did not join varsity clubs: 60 - 20 = 40.

User: In a game, Samanta has 8 more points than Mark, and Mark has 50% more points than Eric. Eric has 6 points. How many points do Samanta, Mark, and Eric have in total?
