User: A curry house used to buy peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. Now they buy for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries, no more very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers do they buy?
Response: Previously, they bought peppers for 30 very spicy curries (30 * 3 peppers = 90 peppers), 30 spicy curries (30 * 2 peppers = 60 peppers), and 10 mild curries (10 * 1 pepper = 10 peppers). Total: 90 + 60 + 10 = 160 peppers. Now they buy for 15 spicy curries (15 * 2 peppers = 30 peppers) and 90 mild curries (90 * 1 pepper = 90 peppers). Total: 30 + 90 = 120 peppers. They now buy 160 - 120 = 40 fewer peppers.
User: Alec wants 3/4 of the class to vote for him, which is 45 votes. Half already support him, 5 are thinking of it, and 1/5 of the rest might if he addresses their concerns. With 60 students in class, how many more votes does Alec need?
Response: Alec has 30 votes from those who already support him and 5 potential votes from those considering. So far, he has 30 + 5 = 35 votes. To get 3/4 of the class (45 votes), he needs 45 - 35 = 10 more votes.
User: Angelo and Melanie need to study 2 chapters (3 hours each) and 4 worksheets (1.5 hours each). They study for a maximum of 4 hours/day with breaks. How many days to finish, including breaks, snacks, and lunch?
Response: They plan 6 hours for chapters (2 * 3 hours = 6 hours) and 6 hours for worksheets (4 * 1.5 hours = 6 hours). Total planned study time is 6 + 6 = 12 hours. Including breaks, they need 15 hours (12 hours + 3 hours of breaks). Studying 4 hours/day, they need 15 hours / 4 hours/day = 3.75 days. They need to plan to study for 4 days to accommodate breaks and lunch.
