User: Janet hires six employees. Four are warehouse workers making $15/hour, and two are managers making $20/hour. Janet pays 10% in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, what's the total cost for their wages and taxes for one month?
Response: To calculate the total cost, first, find each worker's monthly wage. Warehouse workers earn $15/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days/month = $3,000/month. Managers earn $20/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days/month = $4,000/month. The total wages are $3,000 (workers) + $4,000 (managers) = $7,000. Now, calculate the FICA tax, which is 10% of the total wages: $7,000 * 0.10 = $700. The grand total is $7,000 (wages) + $700 (taxes) = $7,700.
User: Sam works at the Widget Factory. He assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes. Jack helps and they assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes. Tony worked a full 8-hour shift. They completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble one widget?
Response: Sam takes 10 minutes to assemble 1 widget. Jack takes the same time, so they both take 10 minutes per widget. Tony produced the remaining 68 - 36 (Sam) - 16 (Jack) = 16 widgets. Tony took 8 hours to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 16 widgets = 30 minutes per widget.
User: Sarah and Ellie got lost in a house of mirrors. Sarah saw her reflection 10 times in tall mirrors and 5 times in wide mirrors. Ellie saw her reflection 6 times in tall mirrors and 3 times in wide mirrors. They each passed tall mirrors 3 times and wide mirrors 5 times. How many times did they see their reflections in total?
Response: Sarah saw her reflection 10 times (tall mirrors) + 5 times (wide mirrors) = 15 times in one pass. Ellie saw her reflection 6 times (tall mirrors) + 3 times (wide mirrors) = 9 times in one pass. Together, they saw their reflections 15 times (Sarah) + 9 times (Ellie) = 24 times in one pass. They passed tall mirrors 3 times and wide mirrors 5 times, so the total reflections they saw are 24 times (one pass) * 3 (passes) + 24 times (one pass) * 5 (passes) = 72 times + 120 times = 192 times in total.
User: The curry house used to buy peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. Now they buy for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers do they buy now?
Response: Previously, the curry house bought 3 peppers per very spicy curry * 30 very spicy curries + 2 peppers per spicy curry * 30 spicy curries + 1 pepper per mild curry * 10 mild curries = 90 + 60 + 10 = 160 peppers. Now, they buy 2 peppers per spicy curry * 15 spicy curries + 1 pepper per mild curry * 90 mild curries = 30 + 90 = 120 peppers. The difference is 160 peppers (before) - 120 peppers (now) = 40 fewer peppers.
User: Hasan filled a box with 38 dinner plates. The scale reported it was too heavy. He removed plates until it was acceptable. Each plate weighs 10 ounces, and the scale's limit is 20 pounds. How many plates did he need to remove?
Response: Hasan had to remove plates until the box was under the 20-pound limit. Each plate weighs 10 ounces, which is 10/16 pounds. So, the original weight was 38 plates * 10/16 pounds per plate = 23.75 pounds. He needed to remove enough plates to get the weight under 20 pounds. The difference is 23.75 pounds (original) - 20 pounds (limit) = 3.75 pounds. To find out how many plates to remove, divide 3.75 pounds / (10/16 pounds per plate) = 6 plates.
User: Alec wants 3/4 of the class to vote for him to win Class President. Half the class already supports him, and 5 are considering it. He surveys others, makes changes, and now has a fifth of them considering. The class has 60 students. How many more votes does he need?
Response: Alec's goal is to get 3/4 of the class to vote for him, which is 3/4 * 60 students = 45 votes. He already has half the class, which is 60 students / 2 = 30 votes. Additionally, 5 students are considering it, so that's 30 votes (half) + 5 votes (considering) = 35 votes. Alec needs 45 votes (goal) - 35 votes (current) = 10 more votes to reach his goal.
