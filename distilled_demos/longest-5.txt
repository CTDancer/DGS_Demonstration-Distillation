User: Janet hires six employees. Four are warehouse workers making $15/hour, and two are managers making $20/hour. Janet pays 10% of their salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month, 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe for wages and taxes in one month?
Response: To calculate, we start with each worker's monthly wage. Warehouse workers make $15/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days = $3000/month. Managers make $20/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days = $4000/month. In total, warehouse workers cost $12,000, and managers cost $8,000. Adding them gives $20,000 for wages. FICA taxes are 10% of this, so taxes amount to $2,000. Thus, the total is $22,000.
