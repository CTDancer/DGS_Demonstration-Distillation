User: Janet hires six employees. Four are warehouse workers earning $15/hour, and two are managers earning $20/hour. She pays 10% in FICA taxes. Assuming 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, what's the total cost for wages and taxes for one month?
Response:\n - Warehouse worker monthly wage: $15/hour * 25 days * 8 hours/day = $3000.\n - Total warehouse workers' monthly wages: $3000/worker * 4 workers = $12,000.\n - Manager monthly wage: $20/hour * 25 days * 8 hours/day = $4000.\n - Total managers' monthly wages: $4000/manager * 2 managers = $8000.\n - Total monthly wages: $12,000 (warehouse workers) + $8000 (managers) = $20,000.\n - FICA taxes: 10% of $20,000 = $2000.\n - Total cost for wages and taxes: $20,000 (wages) + $2000 (taxes) = $22,000.\n Answer: $22,000
User: Ellie and Sarah got lost in a house of mirrors. Sarah saw her reflection 10 times in tall mirrors and 5 times in wide mirrors. Ellie saw her reflection 6 times in tall mirrors and 3 times in wide mirrors. Both passed through tall mirrors 3 times and wide mirrors 5 times each. How many times did they see their reflections in total?
Response:\n - Sarah's tall mirror reflections: 10 reflections * 3 passes = 30 times.\n - Sarah's wide mirror reflections: 5 reflections * 5 passes = 25 times.\n - Ellie's tall mirror reflections: 6 reflections * 3 passes = 18 times.\n - Ellie's wide mirror reflections: 3 reflections * 5 passes = 15 times.\n - Total reflections for Sarah: 30 (tall mirrors) + 25 (wide mirrors) = 55 times.\n - Total reflections for Ellie: 18 (tall mirrors) + 15 (wide mirrors) = 33 times.\n - Combined total for Sarah and Ellie: 55 + 33 = 88 times.\n Answer: 88 times
User: A curry house adjusted its pepper purchases. Previously, they bought peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. Now, they buy peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers do they buy?
Response:\n - Previous total peppers bought: (3 peppers * 30 very spicy curries) + (2 peppers * 30 spicy curries) + (1 pepper * 10 mild curries) = 160 peppers.\n - New total peppers bought: (2 peppers * 15 spicy curries) + (1 pepper * 90 mild curries) = 120 peppers.\n - Difference: 160 (previous) - 120 (new) = 40 fewer peppers.\n Answer: 40 peppers fewer
User: Peggy wants to sell her 200 records. Sammy offers $4 each for all of them. Bryan offers $6 each for half and $1 each for the rest. Peggy's records. What's the profit difference between Sammy and Bryan's deals?
Response:
 - Sammy's offer: $4/record * 200 records = $800.

 - Total from Bryan: $600 + $100 = $700.\n - Difference in profit: $800 (Sammy) - $700 (Bryan) = $100.
  Answer: $100
