Q: A salesman bought a case of 48 backpacks for $576. He sold 17 of them for $18 at the swap meet, 10 were sold to a department store for $25 each. If the remainder were sold for $22 each. How much was the salesman's profit?
A: The salesman sold 17 bags for 17 bags x $18/bag = $306. He sold 10 more for 10 bags x $25/bag = $250. Thus far he has sold 17 bags + 10 bags = 27 bags. Therefore he sold 48 bags - 27 bags = 21 bags for $22 each. 21 bags were sold for 21 bags x $22/bag = $462. In total the salesman made $306 + $250 + $462 = $1018. The salesman made $1018 - $576 = $442 in profit. Therefore the answer is 442.

Q: A store sold a certain brand of jeans for $40. They only have few pairs of jeans left so they decided to give 10% discount on every two pairs of jeans bought by a customer at any one time. How much will a customer pay for 3 pairs of jeans?
A: Two pairs of jeans cost $40 x 2 = $80. A discount of $80 x 10/100 = $8 will be given for this. Hence, the cost of two pairs of jeans will now be $80 - $8 = $72. Therefore, the customer will pay $72 + $40 = $112 for the three pairs of jeans. Therefore the answer is 112.
Q: A retail store wants to hire 50 new phone reps to assist with the increased call volume that they will experience over the holiday.  Each phone rep will work 8 hours a day and will be paid $14.00 an hour.  After 5 days, how much will the company pay all 50 new employees?
A: There are 50 reps and they will work 8 hour days so that's 50*8 = 400 hours. They will work 5 days a week so that's 5*400 = 2,000 hours. Each worker will be paid $14.00 an hour and in 5 days they will have worked 2,000 hours so that's 14*2000 = $28,000. Therefore the answer is 28000.
Q: In a factory, there are 300 employees. 200 of them earn $12 per hour. Of the rest, 40 of them earn $14 per hour. All others earn $17 per hour. What is the cost to employ all these people for one 8-hour long shift?
A: The cost of the 200 employees is 200 employees * $12/employee/hour = $2400 per hour. The cost of the 40 employees is 40 employees * $14/employee/hour = $560 per hour. The rest means 300 employees - 200 employees - 40 employees = 60 employees. These 60 employees' employment costs are at 60 employees * $17/employee/hour = $1020 per hour. So in total all employees earn $2400/hour + $560/hour + $1020/hour = $3980/hour. During an 8-hour shift, this cost would be at 8 hours * $3980/hour = $31840. Therefore the answer is 31840.
