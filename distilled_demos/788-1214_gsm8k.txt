Sure, I'll distill the given User-Response pairs while preserving all the necessary information and response logic. 

```User: Jeremie wants to go to an amusement park with 3 friends at the end of summer. Tickets are $18 for children and a set of snack cost $5. How much will it cost Jeremie and her 3 friends to go to the amusement park and buy each of them a set of snacks?
Response: 4 people will go to the park. Tickets are $18 each, and snacks cost $5 per set. So, it's 4 x ($18 + $5) = $92 in total.

User: Summer and Jolly both went to the same middle school. However, when they finished college, Summer had five more degrees than Jolly. If Summer has a total of 150 degrees, what's the combined number of degrees they both have?
Response: Jolly has 150 - 5 = 145 degrees. Combined, they have 150 + 145 = 295 degrees.

User: Uncle Bradley has a $1000 bill that he wants to change into smaller bills so he could give them to his nieces and nephews. He wants to change 3/10 of the money into $50 bills while the rest into $100 bills. How many pieces of bills will Uncle Bradley have in all?
Response: $300 will be in $50 bills (3/10 x $1000), which is 6 bills. The remaining $700 will be in $100 bills, which is 7 bills. In total, he'll have 6 + 7 = 13 bills.

User: Leo had 400 marbles in a jar. He gave Manny 1/4 of the number of packs of marbles, and Neil received 1/8 of the number of packs of marbles. How many packs of marbles did Leo keep?
Response: Leo had 40 packs of marbles. He gave Manny 10 packs and Neil 5 packs. So, he kept 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 packs.

User: Joy has 30 pencils, and Colleen has 50 pencils. If they bought the pencils at $4 each, how much more money did Colleen pay than Joy for her pencils?
Response: Colleen has 20 more pencils than Joy, so she paid $4 x 20 = $80 more.

User: Angus, Patrick, and Ollie went fishing for trout on Rainbow Lake. Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick did, but Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus. If Ollie caught 5 fish, how many fish did Patrick catch?
Response: Angus caught 12 fish, and Patrick caught 8 fish.

User: It takes 5 people to lift a car and twice as many people to lift a truck. How many people are needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks?
Response: It takes 10 people to lift a truck. To lift 6 cars, you'd need 5 x 6 = 30 people, and to lift 3 trucks, you'd need 10 x 3 = 30 people. In total, 30 + 30 = 60 people are needed.

User: Last month, a factory made 12000 dolls and their associated accessories. The accessories for each doll included 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats. If each doll took 45 seconds to make and each accessory took 10 seconds to make, what was the total combined machine operation time, in seconds, required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories?
Response: The factory made 24000 shoes, 36000 bags, 12000 cosmetics sets, and 60000 hats. Dolls took 540000 seconds, and accessories took 1320000 seconds to make. So, in total, it took 1860000 seconds.
