User: A salesman bought a case of 48 backpacks for $576. He sold 17 of them for $18 at the swap meet, 10 were sold to a department store for $25 each. If the remainder were sold for $22 each. How much was the salesman's profit?
Response: The salesman sold 17 bags for 17 bags x $18/bag = $306. He sold 10 more for 10 bags x $25/bag = $250. Thus far he has sold 17 bags + 10 bags = 27 bags. Therefore he sold 48 bags - 27 bags = 21 bags for $22 each. 21 bags were sold for 21 bags x $22/bag = $462. In total the salesman made $306 + $250 + $462 = $1018. The salesman made $1018 - $576 = $442 in profit. Therefore the answer is 442.
