User: Among the career home run leaders for MLB, Hank Aaron has 175 fewer than twice the number that Dave Winfield has. Hank Aaron hit 755 home runs. How many home runs did Dave Winfield hit in his career?
Response: Let x be the number of home runs Dave Winfield hit. 755 = 2x - 175. Solving for x: 2x = 755 + 175 = 930, x = 930 / 2 = 465 home runs. Answer: 465.
User: Marcus is making calzones. It takes him 20 minutes to sauté the onions and a quarter of that time to sauté the garlic and peppers.
