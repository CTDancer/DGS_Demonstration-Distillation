User: Janet hires six employees. Four are warehouse workers at $15/hour, and two are managers at $20/hour. She pays 10% in FICA taxes. They work 25 days a month, 8 hours a day. What's the total cost for wages and taxes for one month?
Response: Calculate each worker's monthly wage: Warehouse worker = $15/hour * 200 hours = $3,000. Manager = $20/hour * 200 hours = $4,000. Now multiply by the number of workers for each category: Warehouse workers = $3,000 * 4 = $12,000. Managers = $4,000 * 2 = $8,000. Add both categories: $12,000 + $8,000 = $20,000. Calculate FICA tax: 10% of $20,000 = $2,000. Add wages and taxes: $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000.
User: Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes. Jack helps make 2 widgets in 15 minutes. Tony worked 8 hours, and they made 68 widgets. How long does Tony take to assemble a widget in minutes?
Response: Sam = 10 minutes/widget. Jack = 15 minutes/2 widgets = 7.5 minutes/widget. Sam's production in 6 hours = 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 10 minutes/widget = 36 widgets. Jack's production in 4 hours = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 7.5 minutes/widget = 32 widgets. Tony's production = Total - Sam's - Jack's = 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 32 widgets = 0 widgets. Tony's time = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes. Tony's time per widget = 480 minutes / 0 widgets = Undefined.
User: Sarah saw her reflection 10 times in tall mirrors and 5 times in wide mirrors. Ellie saw 6 times in tall mirrors and 3 times in wide mirrors. They passed tall mirrors 3 times and wide mirrors 5 times. How many times did they see their reflections in total?
Response: Sarah in tall mirrors = 10 times * 3 passes = 30 times. In wide mirrors = 5 times * 5 passes = 25 times. Ellie in tall mirrors = 6 times * 3 passes = 18 times. In wide mirrors = 3 times * 5 passes = 15 times. Total reflections = Sarah + Ellie = 30 + 25 + 18 + 15 = 88 times.
User: The curry house bought 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 for spicy, and 1 for mild. Previously, they bought peppers for 30 very spicy, 30 spicy, and 10 mild curries. Now they buy for 15 spicy and 90 mild curries. No more very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers do they buy now?
Response: Previous peppers = 3 peppers/very spicy * 30 very spicy + 2 peppers/spicy * 30 spicy + 1 pepper/mild * 10 mild = 90 + 60 + 10 = 160 peppers. Current peppers = 2 peppers/spicy * 15 spicy + 1 pepper/mild * 90 mild = 30 + 90 = 120 peppers. Difference = 160 - 120 = 40 peppers.
