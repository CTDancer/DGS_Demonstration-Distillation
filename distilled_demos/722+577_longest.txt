User: Janet hires six employees. Four are warehouse workers making $15/hour, and two are managers making $20/hour. Janet pays 10% of their salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month, 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe for wages and taxes in one month?
Response: To calculate, we start with each worker's monthly wage. Warehouse workers make $15/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days = $3000/month. Managers make $20/hour * 8 hours/day * 25 days = $4000/month. In total, warehouse workers cost $12,000, and managers cost $8,000. Adding them gives $20,000 for wages. FICA taxes are 10% of this, so taxes amount to $2,000. Thus, the total is $22,000.

Response: Sam takes 10 minutes/widget. Jack helps in 15 minutes, completing 2 widgets, so Jack takes 7.5 minutes/widget. Tony took 8 hours to complete 16 widgets, so he takes 30 minutes/widget.

User: Alec is running for Class President. He thinks that if he can get three-quarters of the class to vote for him then there is no chance anyone else can beat him. Half of the class have already said they will vote for him but out of the remaining students, only 5 have said they are thinking about voting for him. He surveys the students who are thinking about voting for someone else, and changes his flyers to reflect the issues these students are concerned about. This results in a fifth of these students saying they'll vote for him. If Alec's class has 60 students and everyone who said they will vote for him does so, how many more votes does Alec need to reach his goal number of votes?
Response: Alec's goal is to get three-quarters of the class to vote for him, which is 60 students * 3/4 = 45 votes. Currently, he has 30 votes from half the class and an additional 5 students considering voting for him. So, he has 30 + 5 = 35 votes. To reach his goal, he needs 45 - 35 = 10 more votes.
User: Peggy is moving and is looking to get rid of her record collection. Sammy says that he will buy all of them for 4 dollars each. Bryan is only interested in half of the records but will offer 6 dollars each for the half that he is interested in and 1 dollar each for the remaining half that he is not interested in with the hopes that he can resell them in bulk later. If Peggy has 200 records, what is the difference in profit between Sammy versus Bryan's deal?
Response: Sammy offers $4 each for all 200 records, totaling $4 * 200 = $800. Bryan offers $6 each for half (100 records * $6 = $600) and $1 each for the other half (100 records * $1 = $100). The difference in profit between Sammy and Bryan's deals is $800 - ($600 + $100) = $100.
User: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?
Response: Angelo and Melanie have 2 chapters, each requiring 3 hours (2 * 3 = 6 hours), and 4 worksheets, each needing 1.5 hours (4 * 1.5 = 6 hours). In total, they need to dedicate 6 + 6 = 12 hours to their study materials. They plan to study no more than 4 hours per day. Accounting for breaks, including 10-minute breaks every hour, 3 10-minute snack breaks, and 30 minutes for lunch, they need an additional 3 hours each day. Thus, they need 12 hours + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours per day. Over the next week, they should plan to study for 15 hours / 4 hours per day = 3.75 days, which they should round up to 4 days.
