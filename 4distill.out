distilled_demos is: ```User: Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the children’s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Response: Isabelle needs to earn $40 in total ($20 for her ticket and $20 for her brothers' tickets). They have already saved $10, so she needs to earn an additional $30. At $3 per week, it will take her 10 weeks to save enough money. Therefore, the answer is 10.

User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?
Response: Tyson is 20 years old. Frederick is 2 * 20 = 40 years old. Julian is 40 - 20 = 20 years old. Kyle is 5 years older than Julian, making him 25 years old. Therefore, the answer is 25.

User: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, with both costing $20 each. If she got a 20% discount on the pencils and bought 100 cucumbers, calculate the total amount she spent to buy the items.
Response: Isabela bought 100/2 = 50 pencils. The total cost of pencils without the discount is $20 * 50 = $1000. With a 20% discount, she paid $1000 * 0.2 = $200 less. So, the cost of pencils after the discount is $1000 - $200 = $800. She also bought 100 cucumbers at a cost of $20 each, totaling $20 * 100 = $2000. The total amount spent is $800 (pencils) + $2000 (cucumbers) = $2800. Therefore, the answer is 2800.

User: Of the 24 students in class, one-third are in the after-school chess program, and half of those students will be absent from school on Friday for the regional chess tournament. How many of the students in this class are going to that tournament?

Response: Tony's speed is 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour. If he drives 200 miles at the same speed, it will take him 200 miles / 40 miles per hour = 5 hours. Therefore, the answer is 5.

User: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally for 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Response: Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts, so in total, they will use 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards of ribbon. Josh initially has 18 yards, so he will have 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards of ribbon left. Therefore, the answer is 6.

User: Jenna's doctor tells her that she should tan no more than 200 minutes a month. If she tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week for the first two weeks of the month, how many minutes can she tan in the last two weeks of the month?

User: Isabelle gets a job to save for a concert. Tickets cost $20 each. Her brothers have $5 saved, and she earns $3 per week. How many weeks to afford the tickets?
Response: Isabelle needs $40 for tickets, her brothers saved $5, so she needs $35 more. At $3 per week, it will take her 35 / 3 = 11.67 weeks. Therefore, she needs 12 weeks.

User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?
Response: Tyson is 20 years old, Frederick is 40, Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick, making him 20 - 20 = 0 years old. Kyle is 5 years older than Julian, so he is 0 + 5 = 5 years old.

User: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, each costing $20. With a 20% discount on pencils and 100 cucumbers, what's the total cost?
Response: Isabela bought 100 cucumbers and twice as many pencils, which is 200 pencils. Pencils cost $20 each with a 20% discount, so they cost $20 - (20% of $20) = $16 each. Pencils cost 200 * $16 = $3200. Cucumbers cost 100 * $20 = $2000. The total cost is $3200 (pencils) + $2000 (cucumbers) = $5200. Therefore, the total cost is $5200.

User: Of the 24 students in class, one-third are in the chess program, and half of them will be absent for the tournament. How many students are going to the tournament?
Response: There are 24 students in total, one-third are in the chess program, which is 24 * (1/3) = 8 students. Half of them, which is 8 * (1/2) = 4 students, will be absent for the tournament. Therefore, 4 students are going to the tournament.

User: In a bowl of fruit, there are 2 bananas, twice as many apples, and some oranges. In total, there are 12 fruits. How many oranges are in the bowl?
Response: There are 2 bananas and twice as many apples, which means 2 * 2 = 4 apples. So, there are 12 - 4 (apples) - 2 (bananas) = 6 oranges in the bowl. Therefore, there are 6 oranges.

User: Tony's towns are 120 miles apart, and he takes 3 hours to drive. If he drives to a friend's town 200 miles away at the same speed, how long will it take?
Response: Tony's speed is 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour. For a 200-mile drive at the same speed, it will take him 200 miles / 40 miles per hour = 5 hours. Therefore, it will take him 5 hours.

User: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon for 6 gifts, each using 2 yards. How many yards of ribbon will be left?
Response: Each gift uses 2 yards, so in total, they will use 6 * 2 = 12 yards of ribbon. Josh initially has 18 yards, so he will have 18 - 12 = 6 yards of ribbon left. Therefore, there are 6 yards left.

distilled_demos is: ```User: Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the children’s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Response: Isabelle needs to earn $40 in total for the tickets ($20 for her ticket and $10 each for her brothers' tickets). They have saved $10 already. Isabelle earns $3 per week. So, she will need to work for (40 - 10) / 3 = 10 weeks to afford the tickets. Therefore, the answer is 10.

User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?
Response: Tyson is 20 years old. Frederick is 2 * 20 = 40 years old. Julian is 40 - 20 = 20 years old. Kyle is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. Therefore, the answer is 25.

User: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, with both costing $20 each. If she got a 20% discount on the pencils and bought 100 cucumbers, calculate the total amount she spent to buy the items.
Response: Isabela bought 100 cucumbers and 50 pencils. The pencils cost $20 each, but with a 20% discount, they cost $20 - ($20 * 0.20) = $16 each. So, the pencils cost $16 * 50 = $800. The cucumbers cost $20 each, so they cost $20 * 100 = $2000. The total amount spent is $800 + $2000 = $2800. Therefore, the answer is 2800.

Response: There are 24 students in the class. One-third are in the chess program, which is 24 * (1/3) = 8 students. Half of these 8 students will be absent, so 8 * (1/2) = 4 students are going to the tournament. Therefore, the answer is 4.

User: In a bowl of fruit, there are 2 bananas, twice as many apples, and some oranges. In total there are 12 fruits in the bowl. How many oranges are in the bowl?
Response: There are twice as many apples as bananas, so there are 2 * 2 = 4 apples. The total number of fruits is 12. So, there are 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 oranges in the bowl. Therefore, the answer is 6.

User: Tony is driving his car between his town and a friend's down. The towns are 120 miles apart and he gets there in 3 hours. The next day, he is driving to see another friend who lives 200 miles away from his friend. If he drives at the same speed, how long will the drive take?
Response: Tony is driving at a speed of 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour. If he drives 200 miles at the same speed, it will take him 200 miles / 40 miles per hour = 5 hours. Therefore, the answer is 5.

User: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally for 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Response: Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts, so in total, they will use 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards of ribbon. Josh has 18 yards in total, so 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards of ribbon will be left. Therefore, the answer is 6.

User: Jenna's doctor tells her that she should tan no more than 200 minutes a month. If she tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week for the first two weeks of the month, how many minutes can she tan in the last two weeks of the month?
Response: Jenna tans for 30 minutes a day for 2 days a week for the first 2 weeks, which is a total of 30 minutes/day * 2 days/week * 2 weeks = 120 minutes in the first half of the month. She is allowed to tan for a maximum of 200 minutes a month, so she can tan for 200 minutes - 120 minutes = 80 minutes in the last two weeks of the month. Therefore, the answer is 80.

distilled_demos is: I apologize for any previous omissions. Here's the distillation with more necessary information included in each User message while still meeting all the requirements:

```User: Isabelle works to save money for concert tickets. Her job pays $3 per week. Tickets cost $40 in total. She has $10 saved. How many weeks must she work to afford tickets?
Response: Isabelle needs to earn $40 for the tickets ($20 each for 2 brothers and herself). With $10 saved, she needs $30 more. At $3 per week, it will take 10 weeks to afford the tickets.

User: Kyle's age compared to Tyson's. Tyson is 20. Kyle's age?
Response: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian, who is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson, who is 20. So, Kyle is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

User: Isabela buys 100 cucumbers and 50 pencils. Pencils cost $16 each with a 20% discount. Total spent?
Response: Pencils originally cost $20 each, but with a 20% discount, they cost $16 each. So, pencils cost $16 * 50 = $800. Cucumbers cost $20 each, so they cost $20 * 100 = $2000. The total spent is $800 + $2000 = $2800.

User: In a fruit bowl: 2 bananas, twice as many apples, and some oranges. Total fruits: 12. How many oranges?
Response: There are twice as many apples as bananas, so there are 4 apples. Thus, there are 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 oranges in the bowl.

User: Tony drives 120 miles in 3 hours. Speed? Next day, drives 200 miles at the same speed. How long?
Response: Tony's speed is 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 mph. For a 200-mile trip at the same speed, it will take 200 miles / 40 mph = 5 hours.

User: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon for 6 gifts, 2 yards each. Yards left?
Response: Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, so they use a total of 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards of ribbon. Josh has 18 yards in total, so he has 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards of ribbon left.

User: Jenna tans 30 mins, 2 days/week, first 2 weeks. Allowed 200 mins/month. How many in the last 2 weeks?
Response: Jenna can tan for 80 minutes in the last 2 weeks because she's already used 120 minutes in the first 2 weeks (30 mins * 2 days/week * 2 weeks) and is allowed 200 minutes per month.```

User: Isabelle needs money for concert tickets. Her ticket costs $20, and her brothers' tickets cost $10 each. They've saved $10. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks to afford the tickets?
Response: Isabelle needs $40 in total ($20 for her ticket and $20 for her brothers'). They've saved $10, so she needs an additional $30. At $3 per week, it will take her 10 weeks to save enough money. Answer: 10.

User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian, and Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is twice as old as Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?
Response: We start with Tyson's age, which is 20. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick, so Julian is 20 - 20 = 0 years old. Kyle is 5 years older than Julian, which makes Kyle 0 + 5 = 5 years old. Answer: 5.

User: Isabela bought 100 cucumbers and twice as many pencils, both costing $20 each. She also got a 20% discount on pencils. How much did she spend in total?
Response: Isabela bought 100 cucumbers, costing $20 each, for a total of 100 * $20 = $2000. She bought twice as many pencils as cucumbers, which is 2 * 100 = 200 pencils. With a 20% discount on pencils, she spent 200 * $20 * 0.8 = $3200 on pencils. The total cost is $2000 (cucumbers) + $3200 (pencils) = $5200. Answer: $5200.

User: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon for 6 gifts, and each gift uses 2 yards. To find how much ribbon will be left, we subtract the total ribbon used (6 * 2 = 12 yards) from the initial amount. Josh will have 18 - 12 = 6 yards of ribbon left. Answer: 6 yards.

User: Jenna tans for 30 minutes, twice a week for the first two weeks, which totals 30 * 2 * 2 = 120 minutes. She can tan for 200 minutes in total, so she can tan for 200 - 120 = 80 more minutes in the last two weeks. Answer: 80 minutes.

distilled_demos is: User: Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the children’s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?

distilled_demos is: ```User: Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the children’s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Response: Isabelle needs to earn $40 in total ($20 for her ticket and $20 for her brothers' tickets). They have $10 saved already, so she needs to earn an additional $30. At $3 per week, it will take her 10 weeks to afford the tickets. Therefore, the answer is 10.

Response: Tony is driving at a speed of 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour. If he is driving 200 miles, it will take him 200 miles / 40 miles per hour = 5 hours. Therefore, the answer is 5.

She can tan for 200 minutes a month, so she can tan for 200 minutes - 120 minutes = 80 minutes in the last two weeks of the month. Therefore, the answer is 80.```

Then multiply that number by the number of weeks to find how many minutes Jenna tans in the first half of the month: 60 minutes/week * 2 weeks = 120 minutes. Then subtract that time from the total time Jenna can spend tanning to find how many more minutes she can tan: 200 minutes - 120 minutes = 80 minutes. Therefore the answer is 80 minutes.

distilled_demos is: I apologize for the oversight in the previous distillation. Here's the revised distillation with all the necessary information and values retained in each User message:

User: Isabelle wants to save money for a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20, and her brothers' tickets cost $10 each. She saved $5, and her brothers saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Response: Isabelle needs $40 in total (3 tickets x $10 each). She has $10 saved, so she needs $30 more. Working at $3 per week, it will take her 10 weeks to afford the tickets.

User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian, who is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is twice as old as Tyson, who is 20. How old is Kyle?
Response: Tyson is 20 years old. Frederick is twice as old, so he's 40 years old. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick, making him 20 years old as well. Since Kyle is 5 years older than Julian, Kyle is 25 years old.

User: Isabela bought 100 cucumbers and twice as many pencils, both priced at $20 each. She got a 20% discount on the pencils. What's the total amount she spent?
Response: Isabela bought 100 cucumbers for a total of $2000. She bought twice as many pencils as cucumbers, so that's 200 pencils. With a 20% discount, the pencils cost $16 each (20% off of $20). So, the pencils cost $16 x 200 = $3200. The total amount she spent is $2000 (cucumbers) + $3200 (pencils) = $5200.

User: In a class of 24 students, one-third are in an after-school chess program, and half of them will be absent on Friday for a chess tournament. How many students will attend the tournament?
Response: One-third of 24 students are in the chess program, which is 24/3 = 8 students. Half of them will be absent, so 8/2 = 4 students will attend the tournament.

User: In a bowl of fruit, there are 2 bananas, twice as many apples, and some oranges. In total, there are 12 fruits. How many oranges are in the bowl?
Response: There are twice as many apples as bananas, so there are 2 x 2 = 4 apples. The total number of fruits is 2 (bananas) + 4 (apples) + some oranges = 12 fruits. Therefore, there are 12 - 2 - 4 = 6 oranges in the bowl.

User: Tony travels 120 miles in 3 hours to a friend's town. The next day, he drives 200 miles to see another friend. If he drives at the same speed, how long will the second drive take?
Response: Tony drives at a speed of 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour. If he drives 200 miles at the same speed, it will take him 200 miles / 40 miles per hour = 5 hours.

User: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon for 6 gifts, and each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon. How many yards of ribbon will be left?
Response: Josh has 6 gifts, and each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon. So, the total ribbon used is 6 gifts x 2 yards/gift = 12 yards. He initially has 18 yards of ribbon, so he will have 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards of ribbon left.

User: Jenna can tan 30 minutes a day, two days a week, for the first two weeks of the month. How many minutes can she tan in the last two weeks of the month?
Response: Jenna can tan for 30 minutes per day x 2 days per week = 60 minutes per week for the first two weeks. In the last two weeks, she can tan for the same amount, which is 60 minutes per week. Therefore, she can tan for 60 minutes in the last two weeks.

distilled_demos is: ```User: Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the children’s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Response: To afford the tickets, Isabelle needs $40 in total. They have $10 saved already. So, she must earn an additional $30. Since she makes $3 per week, it will take her 10 weeks to save enough. Answer: 10

User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?
Response: Tyson is 20, Frederick is 40 (2 times older), Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick, so Julian is 20 - 20 = 0. Kyle is 5 years older than Julian, so Kyle is 5 + 0 = 5 years old. Answer: 5

User: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, with both costing $20 each. If she got a 20% discount on the pencils and bought 100 cucumbers, calculate the total amount she spent to buy the items.
Response: She bought 50 pencils and 100 cucumbers. Pencils cost $20 each with a 20% discount, so she paid $16 each. The pencils cost 50 * $16 = $800. The cucumbers cost 100 * $20 = $2000. The total spent is $800 + $2000 = $2800. Answer: 2800

User: Of the 24 students in class, one-third are in the after-school chess program, and half of those students will be absent from school on Friday for the regional chess tournament. How many of the students in this class are going to that tournament?

Response: He drives at 40 miles per hour (120 miles / 3 hours). If the next drive is 200 miles, it will take him 200 miles / 40 miles per hour = 5 hours. Answer: 5

User: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Response: Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts, so in total, they will use 2 * 6 = 12 yards of ribbon. Josh has 18 yards, so 18 - 12 = 6 yards will be left. Answer: 6

User: Jenna's doctor tells her that she should tan no more than 200 minutes a month. If she tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week for the first two weeks of the month, how many minutes can she tan in the last two weeks of the month?
Response: Jenna tans 30 minutes * 2 days/week = 60 minutes/week for the first two weeks. So, in the first two weeks, she tans 60 minutes/week * 2 weeks = 120 minutes. She has a limit of 200 minutes per month, so in the last two weeks, she can tan 200 minutes - 120 minutes = 80 minutes. Answer: 80```

Her brothers both get the children’s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Response: Isabelle needs to earn $40 in total for the tickets ($20 for her ticket + $10 for each brother's ticket). They have already saved $10, so she needs to earn an additional $30. Since she makes $3 per week, it will take her 10 weeks to save enough money for all the tickets. Therefore, the answer is 10.

User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?

User: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, with both costing $20 each. If she got a 20% discount on the pencils and bought 100 cucumbers, calculate the total amount she spent to buy the items.
Response: Isabela bought 50 pencils (twice as many as cucumbers). The original cost of the pencils is $20 each, so the total cost without a discount is $20 * 50 = $1000. With a 20% discount, she paid $800 for the pencils. She also bought 100 cucumbers at $20 each, totaling $2000. The total amount spent is $800 + $2000 = $2800. Therefore, the answer is $2800.

User: Of the 24 students in class, one-third are in the after-school chess program, and half of those students will be absent from school on Friday for the regional chess tournament. How many of the students in this class are going to that tournament?

Response: Tony is driving at a speed of 120 miles / 3 hours = 40 miles per hour. If he is driving to a friend who lives 200 miles away, it will take him 200 miles / 40 miles per hour = 5 hours. Therefore, the answer is 5 hours.

User: Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the children’s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Response: The tickets for both of her brothers will cost her $10 * 2 = $20. To buy tickets for all of them, it will cost Isabelle $20 + $20 = $40. Between all of them, they have saved a total of $5 + $5 = $10. Since they have already saved $10, she needs to earn an additional $40 - $10 = $30 to afford the tickets. Since she makes $3 per week, it will take her $30 / ($3/week) = 10 weeks to save enough money for all of the tickets. Therefore the answer is 10
User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?

User: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, with both costing $20 each. If she got a 20% discount on the pencils and bought 100 cucumbers, calculate the total amount she spent to buy the items.
Response: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, meaning she bought 100/2 = 50 pencils. The total cost for purchasing the pencils without the discount is 50*$20 = $1000. At a 20% discount, Isabela paid 20/100*$1000 = $200 less. The total amount of money she used to buy the pencils is $1000-$200 = $800. She also bought the cucumbers at a total cost of $20*100=$2000. The total cost for the items is $2000+$800= $2800. Therefore the answer is 2800

User: Jenna's doctor tells her that she should tan no more than 200 minutes a month. If she tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week for the first two weeks of the month, how many minutes can she tan in the last two weeks of the month?
Response: First find how many minutes Jenna tans each of the first two weeks: 30 minutes/day * 2 days/week = 60 minutes/week. Then multiply that number by the number of weeks to find how many minutes Jenna tans in the first half of the month: 60 minutes/week * 2 weeks = 120 minutes. Then subtract that time from the total time Jenna can spend tanning to find how many more minutes she can tan: 200 minutes - 120 minutes = 80 minutes. Therefore the answer is 80
