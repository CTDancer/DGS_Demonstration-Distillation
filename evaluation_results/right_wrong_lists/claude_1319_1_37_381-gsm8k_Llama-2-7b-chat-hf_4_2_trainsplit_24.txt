        "pred_ans": " Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n* Josh runs a car shop \n* He services 3 cars per day\n* He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday\n* So he is open 5 days per week\n* He gets paid $4 per car\n* So in 1 day he makes: \n    - 3 cars x $4 per car = $12\n* In 1 week (5 days) he makes:\n    - $12 per day x 5 days = $60 \n* In 2 weeks (2 x 5 days) he makes:\n    - $60 per week x 2 weeks = $120\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Josh makes in 2 weeks is $120.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n$120",

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book.  If Cindy carries all of her books at once, what will be the total weight of the books she is carrying?",
        "pred_ans": " Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:\n\n- Cindy has math and science books that each weigh 2 pounds\n- She has 2 math and science books, so they weigh 2 * 2 = 4 pounds total\n\n- Her French book weighs 4 pounds\n\n- Her English book weighs 3 pounds \n\n- Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book\n    - English weighs 3 pounds\n    - Twice as much is 2 * 3 = 6 pounds\n\n- So the total weight is:\n    - Math and science books: 4 pounds\n    - French book: 4 pounds \n    - English book: 3 pounds\n    - History book: 6 pounds\n    - Total weight = 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.",
