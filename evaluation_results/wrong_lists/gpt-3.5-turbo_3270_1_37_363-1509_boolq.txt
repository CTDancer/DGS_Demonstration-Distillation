The criteria for the venue are subjective; generally, cities with new ballparks and those who have not hosted the game in a long time--or ever--tend to get selected. Over time, this has resulted in certain cities being selected more often at the expense of others, mainly due to timely circumstances: Cleveland Stadium and the original Yankee Stadium are tied for the most times a venue has hosted the All-Star game, both hosting four games. New York City has hosted more than any other city, having done so nine times in five different stadiums. At the same time, the New York Mets failed to host for 48 seasons (1965--2012), while the Los Angeles Dodgers have not hosted since 1980 (38).

The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, making it easy to wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericized trademark Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. Thread seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten. Question: is thread seal tape the same as teflon tape?",

Less commonly, this solution is referred to as physiological saline or isotonic saline (because it closely approximates isotonic, that is, physiologically normal, solution); although neither of those names is technically accurate (because normal saline is not exactly like blood serum), they convey the practical effect usually seen: good fluid balance with minimal hypotonicity or hypertonicity. NS is used frequently in intravenous drips (IVs) for patients who cannot take fluids orally and have developed or are in danger of developing dehydration or hypovolemia. NS is also used for aseptic purpose. NS is typically the first fluid used when hypovolemia is severe enough to threaten the adequacy of blood circulation, and has long been believed to be the safest fluid to give quickly in large volumes. However, it is now known that rapid infusion of NS can cause metabolic acidosis. Question: is normal saline the same as 0.9 sodium chloride?",

Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means (for example, through the mouth).

The tract may also be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological origin of each segment. The whole human GI tract is about nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy.

        "question": "Passage: A ganglionic blocker (or ganglioplegic) is a type of medication that inhibits transmission between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons in the Autonomic Nervous System, often by acting as a nicotinic receptor antagonist. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are found on skeletal muscle, but also within the route of transmission for the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system (which together comprise the autonomic nervous system). More specifically, nicotinic receptors are found within the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system, allowing outgoing signals to be transmitted from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cells. Thus, for example, blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors blocks both sympathetic (excitatory) and parasympathetic (calming) stimulation of the heart. The nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium, for example, does this by blocking the transmission of outgoing signals across the autonomic ganglia at the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Question: can nicotine be classified as a ganglion blocker?",
        "pred_ans": "Nicotine cannot be classified as a ganglionic blocker. Nicotine is a compound that acts as an agonist, meaning it stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In the context of the Autonomic Nervous System, as mentioned in the passage, nicotinic receptors are found within the ganglia and play a role in transmitting signals between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons. Nicotine, when introduced into the body, binds to these receptors and activates them, leading to the release of neurotransmitters.\n\nIn contrast, ganglionic blockers, as described in the passage, inhibit the transmission of signals between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons by acting as nicotinic receptor antagonists. They block the activation of these receptors, preventing the transmission of signals across the autonomic ganglia.\n\nSo, to answer the question: Nicotine is not classified as a ganglionic blocker; it has a different pharmacological action on nicotinic receptors in the autonomic nervous system.

So, it is possible for a baseball player to catch a ball in the stands, but it comes with certain conditions and risks.",

In early 2018, with dam levels predicted to decline to critically low levels by April, the city announced plans for ``Day Zero'', when if a particular lower limit of water storage was reached, the municipal water supply would largely be shut off, potentially making Cape Town the first major city to run out of water. Through water saving measures and water supply augmentation, by March 2018 the City had reduced its daily water usage by more than half to around 500 million litres (110,000,000 imp gal; 130,000,000 US gal) per day. Combined with good rains in the winter of 2018, by June 2018 dam levels had increased to 43% of capacity, resulting in the City of Cape Town announcing that ``Day Zero'' was unlikely for 2019.

This expressway was initially numbered M-112. In the mid-1950s, state and federal officials planned an Interstate to replace the original route of U.S. Highway 12 (US 12). By 1960, the length of I-94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo. Two years later, the US 12 designation was dropped from the freeway. Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed most of the rest of the route, including the remaining sections between Detroit and Port Huron which superseded the routing of US 25. The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed its connection across the state line. Since completion, I-94 has remained relatively unchanged; a few interchanges have been rebuilt, a second span was constructed for the Blue Water Bridge, and in 1987, a plane crashed on the freeway during take off from the airport in Detroit.

Relative risk includes two important features: (i) a comparison of risk between two ``exposures'' puts risks in context, and (ii) ``exposure'' is ensured by having proper denominators for each group representing the exposure.

Both terms are used to measure the association between an exposure (such as a risk factor or a treatment) and an outcome (such as a disease). Here's the distinction:\n\n1. Relative Risk (RR): Relative risk is often calculated as the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group to the probability of the event occurring in a non-exposed (or comparison) group. It quantifies the likelihood of the event happening in the exposed group compared to the non-exposed group. Mathematically, RR = (Risk in Exposed Group) / (Risk in Non-Exposed Group).\n\n2. Risk Ratio: Risk ratio is another term for relative risk. In many contexts, the terms \"relative risk\" and \"risk ratio\" are used interchangeably. So, if someone is talking about calculating the risk ratio, they are essentially calculating the relative risk.\n\nIn summary, while the terms \"relative risk\" and \"risk ratio\" are often used interchangeably, some researchers and texts may prefer one term over the other. The fundamental concept they represent, comparing the risk of an event between two groups, remains the same. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"False,\" as they refer to the same concept, but \"relative risk\" is the more commonly used term.",

The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting.

        "question": "Passage: Mal de debarquement (or mal de d\u00e9barquement) syndrome (MdDS, or common name disembarkment syndrome) is a neurological condition usually occurring after a cruise, aircraft flight, or other sustained motion event. The phrase ``mal de d\u00e9barquement'' is French and translates to ``illness of disembarkation''. MdDS is typically diagnosed by a neurologist or an ear nose & throat specialist when a person reports a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling (though they are not necessarily rocking). This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience. Because most vestibular testing proves to be negative, doctors may be baffled as they attempt to diagnose the syndrome. A major diagnostic indicator is that most patients feel better while driving or riding in a car, i.e.: while in passive motion. MdDS is unexplained by structural brain or inner ear pathology and most often corresponds with a motion trigger, although it can occur spontaneously. This differs from the very common condition of ``land sickness'' that most people feel for a short time after a motion event such as a boat cruise, aircraft ride, or even a treadmill routine which may only last minutes to a few hours. The syndrome has recently received increased attention due to the number of people presenting with the condition and more scientific research has commenced to determine what triggers MdDS and how to cure it. Question: is it normal to be dizzy after a cruise?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nIt is not normal to be dizzy after a cruise in the sense that experiencing persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing sensations, as described in the passage, is not a typical or common reaction to a cruise. While some individuals may experience a mild form of \"land sickness\" after disembarking from a cruise or other motion event, it usually lasts for a short time, typically minutes to a few hours, and is considered a common and temporary sensation.\n\nThe passage discusses a neurological condition known as Mal de D\u00e9barquement Syndrome (MdDS), which is characterized by persistent and unusual sensations of motion even after the motion event has ended. This syndrome is not a normal or typical response to a cruise or sustained motion, and it is a relatively rare and unexplained condition.\n\nSo, in summary, while mild dizziness or discomfort might be normal for a brief period after a cruise, experiencing persistent and severe sensations of rocking or swaying, as seen in MdDS, is not normal.",

Prior to computerisation, the title document was the 'log book', and this term is sometimes still used to describe the V5C. The V5 document records who the Registered Keeper of the vehicle is; it does not establish legal ownership of the vehicle. These documents used to be blue on the front. However, they were changed to red in 2010/11 after approximately 2.2 million blank blue V5 documents were stolen, allowing thieves to clone stolen vehicles much more easily.

Horizontal and vertical density are usually the same, as most devices have square pixels, but differ on devices that have non-square pixels. Question: is pixel density and resolution the same thing?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation:\nPixel density (PPI or PPCM) and resolution are related concepts, but they are not the same thing.\n\nPixel Density (PPI or PPCM): Pixel density refers to the number of pixels (individual points of color) that are present per unit of length, typically measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or pixels per centimeter (PPCM). It indicates how tightly packed the pixels are on a display or image sensor. Higher pixel density usually results in a sharper and more detailed image. Pixel density is a measure of how many pixels can fit within a specific physical area.\n\nResolution: Resolution, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses both pixel density and the overall dimensions of an image or display. Resolution specifies the total number of pixels in both the horizontal and vertical directions. For example, a display with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels has 1920 pixels horizontally and 1080 pixels vertically. Resolution determines the total number of pixels available for displaying an image but doesn't specify how densely they are packed.\n\nIn summary, pixel density (PPI or PPCM) focuses on the concentration of pixels within a given area, while resolution indicates the total number of pixels in an image or display.

While it's technically possible to use a white background for this technique, it is not commonly done for a few reasons:\n\n1. Lack of Contrast: White backgrounds may not provide enough contrast compared to green or blue backgrounds, making it harder to precisely isolate the subject from the background. Green and blue backgrounds are chosen because they contrast more distinctly with most human skin tones.\n\n2. Potential Spill: When using a white background, there is a risk of color spill or bleed onto the subject, especially if the subject is wearing clothing or has objects of a similar color. This can complicate the keying process and result in less accurate compositing.\n\n3. Industry Standard: Green and blue screens have become industry standards due to their effectiveness and reliability in post-production. Most studios and filmmakers have the necessary equipment and expertise to work with green or blue screens.\n\nWhile it's not impossible to use a white background for chroma keying, it's less practical and less commonly used compared to green or blue backgrounds.

Selective Breeding: This term refers to the process of choosing certain individuals with desirable traits within a population and allowing them to reproduce, with the goal of passing those desirable traits onto the offspring. Selective breeding can be applied to both animals and plants. For example, if you want to breed dogs with a specific coat color or cows with high milk production, you would selectively mate individuals with those traits.\n\n2. Artificial Selection: Artificial selection is a subset of selective breeding.

Artificial selection often involves more direct human intervention and may include techniques like in vitro fertilization or genetic engineering to achieve desired results.\n\nSo, while both artificial selection and selective breeding involve human-guided reproduction to enhance specific traits, artificial selection typically implies a higher degree of human manipulation and the pursuit of traits that may not naturally occur.",

South Africa's position can be seen as an attempt to protect its system of apartheid, which clearly violated several articles in the Declaration. The Saudi Arabian delegation's abstention was prompted primarily by two of the Declaration's articles: Article 18, which states that everyone has the right ``to change his religion or belief''; and Article 16, on equal marriage rights. The six communist countries abstentions centred around the view that the Declaration did not go far enough in condemning fascism and Nazism. Eleanor Roosevelt attributed the abstention of Soviet bloc countries to Article 13, which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries. Question: has saudi arabia signed the universal declaration of human rights?",

However, abstaining from voting on specific articles does not necessarily indicate whether Saudi Arabia has signed the entire Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, and many countries have signed and ratified it. To determine if Saudi Arabia has signed the Declaration, we would need to refer to official documents or sources related to Saudi Arabia's stance on human rights.

Miss Clement began umpiring while a student at Yankton College, and gained fame nationwide for her knowledge of baseball and her accuracy in umpiring the games. She was paid between $10 and $15 per game, which helped pay her tuition. She umpired games in North Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota until at least 1909, and later became a physical education instructor for high school and college women's teams. She still would umpire an occasional semi-pro game in South Dakota even during the 1910s. There were several other woman umpires in the early 1920s: one was Mrs. Deana Ernest of Toledo, Ohio, who umpired semi-pro games in the area, and also managed a city league team there. Another was Nina Belle Hurst, a resident of Sawtelle, California, who umpired in the Southern California Baseball Managers Association. During World War II, there were also some women who umpired, including some the press jokingly referred to as ``WUMPS'' (women umpires). Among them was Lorraine Heinisch, of Kenosha WI, who umpired semi-pro games in 1943, including a championship game in Wichita, Kansas. The first woman to umpire a professional game was Bernice Gera. A former Little League coach and a passionate fan of baseball, she entered umpiring school in 1967 (the first woman ever to attend the Fort Lauderdale Baseball School). After a lengthy court battle with major league baseball, she finally won the right to umpire. Her first pro game was in the minor leagues in June 1972--a game between the Auburn Phillies and Geneva Rangers in the New York-Penn League, but after several disputed calls, she decided to resign and never umpired another professional game.

They have meat between the bones and on top of the bones, and are shorter, curved, and sometimes meatier than spare ribs. The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage. The shortest bones are typically only about 3 in (7.6 cm) and the longest is usually about 6 in (15 cm), depending on the size of the hog. A pig side has 15 to 16 ribs (depending on the breed), but usually two or three are left on the shoulder when it is separated from the loin. So, a rack of back ribs contains a minimum of eight ribs (some may be trimmed if damaged), but can include up to 13 ribs, depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher.

They tend to be time-related, such as salaries or rents being paid per month, and are often referred to as overhead costs. This is in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related (and are paid per quantity produced). For a simple example, such as a bakery, the monthly rent for the baking facilities, and the monthly payments for the security system and basic phone line are fixed costs, as they do not change according to how much bread the bakery produces and sells. On the other hands, the wage costs of the bakery are variable, as the bakery will have to hire more workers if the production of bread increases. The relation between fixed cost and variable cost can be modelled by an analytical formula. Question: are fixed costs and overhead costs the same?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nFixed costs and overhead costs are related concepts in economics, but they are not the same.\n\nFixed Costs: Fixed costs are business expenses that do not vary with the level of production or the quantity of goods and services produced. These costs remain constant over a certain period and are typically time-related. Examples of fixed costs include monthly rent, salaries of permanent staff, and equipment depreciation. In the given example of the bakery, the monthly rent for the baking facilities and the monthly payments for the security system and basic phone line are fixed costs.\n\nOverhead Costs: Overhead costs are a subset of fixed costs. They represent the ongoing operational expenses of a business that are necessary to keep the business running but are not directly tied to the production of specific goods or services. Overhead costs often include administrative expenses, utilities, office supplies, and similar items. In the context of the bakery, the monthly rent for the baking facilities can be considered an overhead cost.\n\nIn summary, while overhead costs are a type of fixed cost, not all fixed costs are overhead costs.

It is usually expressed in terms of a commonly used international currency such as the euro or United States dollar, and is useful because it is widely known, is easily calculable from readily available gross domestic product (GDP) and population estimates, and produces a useful statistic for comparison of wealth between sovereign territories.

        "pred_ans": "True\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and per capita income are related concepts, but they are not precisely the same. Per capita income is often used as a measure of an area's average income, including countries or regions. It represents the average income earned by each individual in that area. It can be calculated by dividing the total income of the area (which can include not only wages but also things like dividends and rental income) by the total population.\n\nGDP per capita, on the other hand, specifically refers to the average economic output (GDP) generated per person within a country. It measures the economic productivity of a nation on a per-person basis. It is also calculated by dividing the total GDP of a country by its population.\n\nWhile both indicators provide insights into the economic well-being of a region or country, they focus on slightly different aspects. GDP per capita emphasizes economic productivity, while per capita income encompasses a broader range of income sources.

It is an alternative to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Both modalities stent the lungs' alveoli open and thus recruit more of the lung's surface area for ventilation. But while PEEP refers to devices tvt impose positive pressure only at the end of the exhalation, CPAP devices apply continuous positive airway pressure throughout the breathing cycle. Thus, the ventilator itself does not cycle during CPAP, no additional pressure above the level of CPAP is provided, and patients must initiate all of their breaths.

While both are types of companies, there are significant differences between them:\n\n1. **Share Capital:** A plc is required to have a minimum share capital of \u00a350,000, whereas a limited company may have a lower minimum capital requirement or even no minimum requirement, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Shares Trading:** A key distinction is that shares of a plc may be freely sold and traded to the public, as indicated by the \"public\" in its name. In contrast, shares of a limited company are often subject to restrictions on sale and transfer, and they are not typically traded on public stock exchanges.\n\n3. **Name:** Public limited companies usually have the letters \"PLC\" after their name, which is a specific designation to indicate their public status. Limited companies may have different suffixes depending on the jurisdiction, such as \"Ltd\" in the UK.\n\n4. **Legal Identity:** Both types of companies have a separate legal identity, which means they are distinct legal entities from their owners. However, this characteristic is not unique to plc; limited companies also have a separate legal identity.\n\nIn summary, while both public limited companies and limited companies share the feature of being limited liability companies, they differ in terms of share capital requirements, the ability to trade shares publicly, naming conventions, and other legal distinctions.

In the town of Chapel Hill, open carry is restricted to guns of a certain minimum size, under the theory that small, concealable handguns are more often associated with criminal activity. No permit is required to carry a handgun openly in North Carolina. In the court case of State v. Kerner(1921) the defendant ended up getting into some type of confrontation with another man. The defendant proceeded to walk back to his place of work, get his gun, and then return to the scene to fight. The defendant ended up being charged with ``carrying a concealed weapon'' and ``carrying his pistol off his premises unconcealed,'' which violated a local act applicable to Forsyth County and ended up being a misdemeanor. The defendant was taken to trial and the trial judge then dismissed the charge as unconstitutional. The state then appealed, and the supreme court affirmed. During court, the court stated at the beginning that the Second Amendment did not apply, because ``the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are restrictions on the federal authority and not the states.'' Therefore, with that being said, it focused more on the state constitution. The state constitution states that: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The court viewed the provision as protecting the right to carry arms in public. Forsyth County's local act was condemned and seen as distasteful, because it ended up putting a restriction on a persons right to carry a pistol, more so an unconcealed pistol.

This is seen more commonly than hyperdontia. The scientific definition of hyperdontia is ``any tooth or odontogenic structure that is formed from tooth germ in excess of usual number for any given region of the dental arch'' They can be a lot of teeth or not many teeth and can occur on any place in the dental arch.

However, this condition typically does not result in having more than two full sets of teeth. Supernumerary teeth can appear in various areas of the dental arch, but they do not constitute entirely new sets of teeth. It's more about having extra teeth within the existing dental structure.

        "question": "Passage: Most Craftsman hand tools are advertised as having an unlimited lifetime warranty. This lifetime warranty program was instituted by Sears when they began selling the Craftsman line in 1927. This warranty program requires no receipt or dated proof of purchase. If the owner takes the item into a local retail store, it may be replaced or repaired free of charge. In some cases, such as ratchets, the customer may be offered a repair kit with which to repair the item or an already refurbished item. As of 2017, many Sears stores do not offer the kits to consumers, instead they will either rebuild the customer's ratchet or provide one that they have already rebuilt. Ratchet kits for the US made ratchets are different than those for the Asian made ratchets, although some repair kits for the US made ratchets are now made in China (but again, will not interchange with the kits for the Asian ratchets). As of 2018, some stores will supply the customer the rebuild kits for them to rebuild on their own, others will require the customer to have the store employees rebuild the ratchet for them. Question: do all craftsman tools have a lifetime warranty?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation: While most Craftsman hand tools are advertised as having a lifetime warranty, there are certain conditions and variations to this warranty depending on the specific tool and where it was manufactured. As the passage mentions, this warranty program was instituted by Sears in 1927, and it generally does not require a receipt or dated proof of purchase. However, there are some important nuances:\n\n1. **Variation by Product Origin**: The passage notes that there are differences between US-made and Asian-made ratchets in terms of repair kits. Some repair kits for US-made ratchets may now be made in China, but they will not interchange with kits for Asian-made ratchets. This suggests that the warranty and repair options can vary depending on the origin of the tool.\n\n2. **Variation by Store Policy**: The warranty and repair process can also vary by individual stores. As of 2018, some stores may supply rebuild kits for customers to use on their own, while others may require store employees to rebuild the tool for the customer. This means that the experience of utilizing the warranty may differ from store to store.\n\nTherefore, while Craftsman tools generally come with a lifetime warranty, there are variations in the warranty terms and repair options based on factors like the tool's origin and store policies. It's essential to check with the specific store and read the warranty terms for the particular tool in question to understand the coverage and process accurately.",

One may want to express the solutions as explicit numbers; for example, the unique solution of 2x -- 1 = 0 is 1/2. Unfortunately, this is, in general, impossible for equations of degree greater than one, and, since the ancient times, mathematicians have searched to express the solutions as algebraic expression; for example the golden ratio ( 1 + 5 ) / 2 (\\displaystyle (1+(\\sqrt (5)))/2) is the unique positive solution of x 2 \u2212 x \u2212 1 = 0. (\\displaystyle x^(2)-x-1=0.) In the ancient times, they succeeded only for degrees one and two. For quadratic equations, the quadratic formula provides such expressions of the solutions. Since the 16th century, similar formulas (using cube roots in addition to square roots), but much more complicated are known for equations of degree three and four (see cubic equation and quartic equation). But formulas for degree 5 and higher eluded researchers for several centuries. In 1824, Niels Henrik Abel proved the striking result that there are equations of degree 5 whose solutions cannot be expressed by a (finite) formula, involving only arithmetic operations and radicals (see Abel--Ruffini theorem). In 1830, \u00c9variste Galois proved that most equations of degree higher than four cannot be solved by radicals, and showed that for each equation, one may decide whether it is solvable by radicals, and, if it is, solve it. This result marked the start of Galois theory and group theory, two important branches of modern algebra. Galois himself noted that the computations implied by his method were impracticable. Nevertheless, formulas for solvable equations of degrees 5 and 6 have been published (see quintic function and sextic equation). Question: can a polynomial have a square root of a variable?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nThe passage provides historical context about solving equations, particularly polynomial equations, and mentions the limitations of expressing their solutions in algebraic terms. It discusses that mathematicians have succeeded in finding algebraic expressions for solutions of equations of degrees one and two (linear and quadratic equations). However, for equations of degree three and four (cubic and quartic equations), more complicated formulas exist, but they involve not only square roots but also cube roots and are generally more complex.\n\nThe passage goes on to mention that in 1824, Niels Henrik Abel proved that there are equations of degree 5 (quintic equations) whose solutions cannot be expressed by finite formulas involving only arithmetic operations and radicals. This is known as the Abel-Ruffini theorem. Therefore, for equations of degree 5 and higher, square roots alone are not sufficient to express their solutions in algebraic terms.\n\nIn summary, while square roots are used in the context of solving equations, they are not enough to express the solutions of equations of degree 5 or higher, as demonstrated by Abel's theorem.

        "question": "Passage: Sterol lipids, such as cholesterol and its derivatives, are an important component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol and are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as \u03b2-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth.

The noble gases often do not react with many substances, and were historically referred to as the inert gases. Inert gases are used generally to avoid unwanted chemical reactions degrading a sample. These undesirable chemical reactions are often oxidation and hydrolysis reactions with the oxygen and moisture in air. The term inert gas is context-dependent because several of the noble gases can be made to react under certain conditions. Question: is inert gas and noble gas the same?",

Noble gases, on the other hand, are a specific group of elements on the periodic table that includes helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. Noble gases are known for their chemical stability and general lack of reactivity with other substances. While noble gases are often referred to as inert gases historically, they are not synonymous.

MAC addresses are typically represented as a series of hexadecimal numbers, and they are used for device addressing within a local network.\n\n- A physical address, on the other hand, can refer to various types of addresses in different contexts, including memory physical addresses, which are used in computer systems to identify locations in physical memory. In the context of the passage, it's specified that a physical address should not be confused with a memory physical address.

A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire.

This means that while there is an expectation that the batter should attempt to avoid being hit, it is ultimately up to the umpire's discretion to determine if the batter made a genuine effort to do so.\n\nIn practice, batters often do try to move out of the way of a pitch to avoid being hit, but sometimes the pitch is too fast or breaks in a way that makes it difficult to avoid. Umpires will consider these factors when making their judgment.

        "question": "Passage: Because of loop disconnect dialing, attention was devoted to making the numbers difficult to dial accidentally by making them involve long sequences of pulses, such as with the UK 999 emergency number. That said, the real reason that ``999' was chosen is that the preferred ``000'' and ``111'' could not be used: ``111'' dialing could accidentally take place when phone lines were in too close proximity to each other, and ``0'' was already in use by the operator. Subscribers, as they were called then, were even given instructions on how to find the number ``9'' on the dial in darkened, or smoke-filled, rooms, by locating and placing the first finger in the ``0'' and the second in the ``9'', then removing the first when actually dialling. However, in modern times, where repeated sequences of numbers are easily accidentally dialled on mobile phones, this is problematic, as mobile phones will dial an emergency number while the keypad is locked or even without a SIM card. Some people have reported accidentally dialling 112 by loop-disconnect for various technical reasons, including while working on extension telephone wiring, and point to this as a disadvantage of the 112 emergency number, which takes only four loop disconnects to activate. Question: can you call the police with no sim?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nCalling the police without a SIM card is generally not possible on most mobile phones. When you attempt to make a call, your phone typically requires a SIM card to establish a connection with a mobile network provider. Emergency services like the police usually rely on mobile networks to receive emergency calls. Without a SIM card, your phone lacks the necessary network connection to reach emergency services.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some countries or regions may have implemented systems that allow emergency calls even without a SIM card or with an expired SIM card. These systems are designed to ensure that individuals in emergency situations can still reach out for help. In some cases, phones may allow you to make emergency calls with or without a SIM card, but this functionality is not universal and depends on the phone's hardware and local regulations.\n\nIn summary, while there are exceptions and variations, in most cases, you cannot call the police or emergency services without a SIM card in your mobile phone.",

Typically, a woman's fecundity ends with menopause, which by definition is 12 consecutive months without having had any menstrual flow at all. During perimenopause, the menstrual cycle and the periods become irregular and eventually stop altogether, but even when periods are still regular, the egg quality of women in their forties is lower than in younger women, making the likelihood of conceiving a healthy baby also reduced, particularly after age 42.

The current definition is that organisms are open systems that maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve. However, several other biological definitions have been proposed, and there are some borderline cases of life, such as viruses or viroids. In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by ``life'' through obsolete concepts such as odic force, hylomorphism, spontaneous generation and vitalism, that have now been disproved by biological discoveries. Abiogenesis describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core chemical elements to sustain biochemical functions. Question: does all life require the same essential elements?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"does all life require the same essential elements?\" is not entirely accurate. While all life forms share some common essential elements, they do not require exactly the same elements. Organisms are composed of various chemical elements, but the specific elements and their quantities can vary among different types of life.\n\nCommon essential elements for life as we know it include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur (often remembered by the acronym CHONPS). These elements are fundamental to the molecular structures of biological macromolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids.\n\nHowever, the exact requirements can differ. For example, some extremophiles, microorganisms that thrive in extreme environments, may use alternative elements such as arsenic instead of phosphorus in their DNA. Moreover, some life forms, like viruses, are not considered fully independent organisms, and their status as \"life\" is a matter of debate.\n\nSo, while there are common elements essential to many forms of life, there can be variations and exceptions depending on the organism and its specific adaptation to its environment.",

Wind and seismic loads are the most common building codes, including the International Building Code (where it is called a braced wall line) and Uniform Building Code, all exterior wall lines in wood or steel frame construction must be braced. Depending on the size of the building some interior walls must be braced as well. Question: is a shear wall a load bearing wall?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nA shear wall is not necessarily a load-bearing wall in the traditional sense. While it does play a crucial role in the structural integrity of a building by resisting lateral loads such as wind and seismic forces, it may not necessarily carry vertical loads like a typical load-bearing wall, which supports the weight of the floors above it.\n\nA shear wall primarily provides stability and helps prevent the building from swaying excessively during lateral forces. Load-bearing walls, on the other hand, support the vertical weight of the structure. So, while shear walls are an integral part of a building's structural system, they serve a different purpose than load-bearing walls.",

Thus, within a constitutional monarchy the sovereign's direct participation in any of these areas of governance is limited, with the sovereign normally exercising executive authority only on the advice of the executive committee of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, with the sovereign's legislative and judicial responsibilities largely carried out through parliamentarians as well as judges and justices of the peace.

Despite Sean giving many signs of attraction to Alex, she either ignored them or she was oblivious to them since she was emotionally not ready to commit to a relationship with all the things happening in her life. He and Alex share a first kiss in a car with Birkoff driving and Ryan in the passenger seat. In the second-season finale, he tries to ask her out on a date four times, but Alex never lets him finish due to being in action, criticizing that he said that she was a goal, Alex passing out due to a broken arm and being electrocuted, and Nikita interrupting Sean right before he was going to ask Alex while she was in a Division medical facility. At the start of season 3, it appears Alex and Sean are in a relationship. However, by episode 3 it is revealed that Sean is only at Division for Alex, because he loved her. But Alex is at Division because it is the only place she knows as home, where she can be herself, and where her ``family'' (Nikita) is. After a toxin is released in the lab, Sean returns to ask Alex why she's not returning his calls, and asks her again why she's still there. ``I can't tell you what to do, Alex, but I'm not going to stand by and watch this place destroy another person that I love,'' he says before he kisses her. ``I love you, but if that's not enough of a reason for you to leave, I've got no reason to stay.''

While this parallelism can speed up the overall execution of multiple instructions, it can introduce latency for a single task. This is because each instruction has to go through all the pipeline stages, which can result in a delay before the final output is produced.\n\nSo, while pipelining can enhance throughput and overall system efficiency, it may not necessarily reduce latency for a single task.

During this stage the nose is the primary sense organ used by puppies to find their mother's teats, and to locate their littermates, if they become separated by a short distance. Puppies open their eyes about nine to eleven days following birth. At first, their retinas are poorly developed and their vision is poor. Puppies are not able to see as well as adult dogs. In addition, puppies' ears remain sealed until about thirteen to seventeen days after birth, after which they respond more actively to sounds. Between two and four weeks old, puppies usually begin to growl, bite, wag their tails, and bark. Question: can a puppy see when they first open their eyes?",

        "question": "Passage: Open carry is also legal throughout North Carolina. In the town of Chapel Hill, open carry is restricted to guns of a certain minimum size, under the theory that small, concealable handguns are more often associated with criminal activity. No permit is required to carry a handgun openly in North Carolina. In the court case of State v. Kerner(1921) the defendant ended up getting into some type of confrontation with another man. The defendant proceeded to walk back to his place of work, get his gun, and then return to the scene to fight. The defendant ended up being charged with ``carrying a concealed weapon'' and ``carrying his pistol off his premises unconcealed,'' which violated a local act applicable to Forsyth County and ended up being a misdemeanor. The defendant was taken to trial and the trial judge then dismissed the charge as unconstitutional. The state then appealed, and the supreme court affirmed. During court, the court stated at the beginning that the Second Amendment did not apply, because ``the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are restrictions on the federal authority and not the states.'' Therefore, with that being said, it focused more on the state constitution. The state constitution states that: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The court viewed the provision as protecting the right to carry arms in public. Forsyth County's local act was condemned and seen as distasteful, because it ended up putting a restriction on a persons right to carry a pistol, more so an unconcealed pistol. Although, the case of State v. Kerner helped/made more clear the allowance of openly carrying a pistol, it does not preclude all regulations regarding the carrying of firearms. Question: can you open carry in nc with a concealed permit?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation: In North Carolina, as stated in the passage, open carry is legal, and no permit is required to carry a handgun openly. The passage does not mention the need for a concealed carry permit to open carry. Therefore, you can open carry in North Carolina without a concealed carry permit.",

        "question": "Passage: All biomass goes through at least some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented, distilled, and burned. All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance (or ``energy returned on energy invested''). Figures compiled in a 2007 report by National Geographic Magazine point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical climate to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended, as compared to corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended. A 2006 University of California Berkeley study, after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline. Question: does ethanol take more energy make that produces?",

It was originally a black-powder revolver round developed for the Colt Single Action Army revolver. This cartridge was adopted by the U.S. Army in 1873 and served as an official US military handgun cartridge for 14 years. While it is sometimes referred to as .45 Long Colt or .45 LC, to differentiate it from the very popular and ubiquitous .45 ACP, and historically, the shorter .45 S&W Schofield, it was only an unofficial designation by Army quartermasters. Current catalog listings of compatible handguns list the caliber as .45 LC and .45 Colt.

        "question": "Passage: Mal de debarquement (or mal de d\u00e9barquement) syndrome (MdDS, or common name disembarkment syndrome) is a neurological condition usually occurring after a cruise, aircraft flight, or other sustained motion event. The phrase ``mal de d\u00e9barquement'' is French and translates to ``illness of disembarkation''. MdDS is typically diagnosed by a neurologist or an ear nose & throat specialist when a person reports a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling (though they are not necessarily rocking). This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience. Because most vestibular testing proves to be negative, doctors may be baffled as they attempt to diagnose the syndrome. A major diagnostic indicator is that most patients feel better while driving or riding in a car, i.e.: while in passive motion. MdDS is unexplained by structural brain or inner ear pathology and most often corresponds with a motion trigger, although it can occur spontaneously. This differs from the very common condition of ``land sickness'' that most people feel for a short time after a motion event such as a boat cruise, aircraft ride, or even a treadmill routine which may only last minutes to a few hours. The syndrome has recently received increased attention due to the number of people presenting with the condition and more scientific research has commenced to determine what triggers MdDS and how to cure it. Question: is it normal to have motion sickness after a cruise?",

While it is common for some individuals to experience motion sickness during or after activities involving sustained motion, such as a cruise, aircraft flight, or other similar events, it typically lasts for a short time, ranging from minutes to a few hours, and is known as \"land sickness\" or \"sea sickness.\" This is a transient condition caused by the body's adjustment to the motion and usually resolves relatively quickly.\n\nIn contrast, the passage describes a neurological condition called Mal de D\u00e9barquement Syndrome (MdDS), which is not the same as typical motion sickness. MdDS is characterized by a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling that occurs after a motion event, such as a cruise or flight, and can last for an extended period.

The blood--brain barrier is formed by brain endothelial cells and it allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function. Furthermore, it prevents the entry of lipophilic potential neurotoxins by way of an active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein. Astrocytes have been claimed to be necessary to create the blood--brain barrier. A few regions in the brain, including the circumventricular organs, do not have a blood--brain barrier. Question: can protein pass through the blood brain barrier?",
        "pred_ans": "True\n\nProteins typically do not pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under normal circumstances. The BBB is a semipermeable membrane barrier that is highly selective in allowing certain substances to enter the brain while keeping others out. It primarily allows the passage of essential molecules such as glucose and amino acids, which are crucial for neural function, through selective transport mechanisms. \n\nLarge molecules like proteins are usually unable to pass through the BBB by passive diffusion. However, there are specific transport mechanisms, such as receptor-mediated transcytosis, that can facilitate the transport of certain proteins across the BBB, but this process is tightly regulated. Additionally, the BBB actively prevents the entry of many substances, including potential neurotoxins, through mechanisms like active transport mediated by proteins like P-glycoprotein.\n\nSo, while it is possible for some proteins to cross the BBB under specific conditions and with the help of transport mechanisms, it is not a common or straightforward process for most proteins.",

Neutrality of money is an important idea in classical economics and is related to the classical dichotomy. It implies that the central bank does not affect the real economy (e.g., the number of jobs, the size of real GDP, the amount of real investment) by creating money. Instead, any increase in the supply of money would be offset by a proportional rise in prices and wages. This assumption underlies some mainstream macroeconomic models (e.g., real business cycle models). Others like monetarism view money as being neutral only in the long-run.

It mentions that .380 ACP is also known as .380 Auto among other names. However, while these terms are often used interchangeably, they are not technically the same.\n\n.380 ACP and .380 Auto generally refer to the same cartridge, but there can be subtle variations in specifications or naming conventions depending on manufacturers. Therefore, while they are closely related and often used interchangeably, they are not precisely the same. This distinction is due to the potential for variations in manufacturing standards or regional designations.\n\nSo, in summary, .380 Auto is often used to refer to .380 ACP, but there can be slight differences in terminology or specifications depending on context and location.",

Robert's Rules says, ``If the law under which an organization is incorporated allows proxy voting to be prohibited by a provision of the bylaws, the adoption of this book as parliamentary authority by prescription in the bylaws should be treated as sufficient provision to accomplish that result''. Demeter says the same thing, but also states that ``if these laws do not prohibit voting by proxy, the body can pass a law permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired.'' RONR opines, ``Ordinarily it should neither be allowed nor required, because proxy voting is incompatible with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which membership is individual, personal, and nontransferable. In a stock corporation, on the other hand, where the ownership is transferable, the voice and vote of the member also is transferable, by use of a proxy.'' While Riddick opines that ``proxy voting properly belongs in incorporate organizations that deal with stocks or real estate, and in certain political organizations,'' it also states, ``If a state empowers an incorporated organization to use proxy voting, that right cannot be denied in the bylaws.'' Riddick further opines, ``Proxy voting is not recommended for ordinary use.

Most melaleucas are endemic to Australia, with a few also occurring in Malesia. Seven are endemic to New Caledonia, and one is found only on (Australia's) Lord Howe Island. Melaleucas are found in a wide variety of habitats. Many are adapted for life in swamps and boggy places, while others thrive in the poorest of sandy soils or on the edge of saltpans. Some have a wide distribution and are common, whilst others are rare and endangered. Land clearing, exotic myrtle rust, and especially draining and clearing of swamps threaten many species.

This device must be interference fit to the crankshaft in order to operate in an effective manner. An interference fit ensures the device moves in perfect step with crankshaft. It is essential on engines with long crankshafts (such as straight-8 engines) and V8 engines with cross plane cranks. Harmonics and torsional vibrations can greatly reduce crankshaft life, or cause instantaneous failure if the crankshaft runs at or through an amplified resonance. Dampers are designed with a specific weight (mass) which is dependent on the damping material/method used and the freedom it affords the mass move allowing to reduce mechanical Q factor, or damp, crankshaft resonances. A harmonic balancer (sometimes crankshaft damper, torsional damper, or vibration damper) is the same thing as a harmonic damper except that the balancer includes a counterweight to externally balance the rotating assembly. The harmonic balancer often serves as a pulley for the accessory drive belts turning the alternator, water pump and other crankshaft driven devices. Question: is crankshaft pulley and harmonic balancer the same thing?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation:\nA crankshaft pulley and a harmonic balancer are not the same thing, although they are related components in an internal combustion engine.\n\n1. **Harmonic Damper/Harmonic Balancer**: This device is primarily designed to counter torsional and resonance vibrations from the crankshaft. It helps prevent damage to the crankshaft and other engine components caused by these vibrations. A harmonic damper is interference fit to the crankshaft, which means it must be tightly fitted to ensure it moves in perfect step with the crankshaft.\n\n2. **Crankshaft Pulley**: A crankshaft pulley, on the other hand, is a separate component that often serves multiple functions. While it may include the harmonic balancer as part of its design, it also functions as a pulley for the accessory drive belts. These belts are responsible for turning various components like the alternator, water pump, and other crankshaft-driven devices.\n\nSo, while a harmonic balancer is an essential component within a crankshaft pulley, they are not the same thing.

The same effect can be produced with any resonant cavity, such as an empty cup or even by simply cupping one's hand over one's ear. The similarity of the noise produced by the resonator to that of the oceans is due to the resemblance between ocean movements and airflow. Question: can you really hear the ocean in a seashell?",

This phenomenon can be replicated with any resonant cavity, such as an empty cup or cupping one's hand over one's ear.

        "question": "Passage: To maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves. Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a ``dairy bull'' or a ``beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age. A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months. Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days, as the mother/calf bond intensifies over time and delayed separation can cause extreme stress on both cow and calf. Question: do cows need to get pregnant to give milk?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nCows do not need to get pregnant to give milk. Like other mammals, cows can produce milk after giving birth, but they don't need to be continuously pregnant to maintain lactation. In the passage, it is mentioned that to maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves, but this is specifically about the practice on dairy farms to maximize milk production. Once a cow gives birth, it starts producing milk, and this milk can be collected for human consumption. However, to maintain high milk production levels, dairy farmers often follow a cycle of breeding cows to keep them in a state of lactation.\n\nSo, while cows can produce milk without being pregnant, the passage highlights the common practice in dairy farming of breeding cows to ensure a consistent supply of milk.",

        "question": "Passage: The redback is one of the few spider species that can be seriously harmful to humans, and its liking for habitats in built structures has led it to being responsible for a large number of serious spider bites in Australia. Predominantly neurotoxic to vertebrates, the venom gives rise to the syndrome of latrodectism in humans; this starts with pain around the bite site, which typically becomes severe and progresses up the bitten limb and persists for over 24 hours. Sweating in localised patches of skin occasionally occurs and is highly indicative of latrodectism. Generalised symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, and agitation may also occur and indicate severe envenomation. An antivenom has been available since 1956. There have been no deaths directly due to redback bites since its introduction, however Isbister et al. have suggested patients for whom antivenom is considered should be fully informed ``there is considerable weight of evidence to suggest it is no better than placebo'', and in light of a risk of anaphylaxis and serum sickness, ``routine use of the antivenom is therefore not recommended''. As of the 2013 (updated 2014) edition of the Snakebite & Spiderbite Clinical Management Guidelines from NSW HEALTH (latest available in 2017), Red-back spider bites were considered not life-threatening but capable of causing severe pain and systemic symptoms that could continue for hours to days. Question: can a red back spider bite kill you?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nA redback spider bite is typically not fatal to humans. While their venom can cause severe pain and various symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, headache, and agitation, as described in the passage, there have been no reported deaths directly attributed to redback spider bites since the introduction of antivenom in 1956. However, it's important to note that individual reactions to spider bites can vary, and in some cases, severe envenomation may occur, necessitating medical attention and antivenom administration. Still, in general, a redback spider bite is not considered lethal.",

        "question": "Passage: At the time, larger sport utility vehicles tended to use pickup truck-based, body-on-frame designs. Other car makers, Jeep, Toyota and Honda had been offering smaller unibody designs, the Jeep Cherokee (XJ), RAV4 and CR-V respectively. Solid rear axles were commonly used on the full sized truck based SUVs and Jeep Cherokee due to their ability to carry heavy loads at the expense of a comfortable ride and good handling. Ford and Mazda decided to offer a car-like, unibody design with a fully independent suspension and rack and pinion steering similar to the RAV4 and CR-V, the Escape. Although not meant for serious off-roading, a full-time all-wheel-drive (AWD) system supplied by Dana was optional, which included a locking center differential activated by a switch on the dashboard. The AWD system normally sends most of the power from the engine to the front wheels. If slipping is detected at the front, more power will be sent to the rear wheels in a fraction of a second. The four wheel drive system was a newer version of Ford's ``Control Trac'' 4x4 system, dubbed the Control Trac II 4WD in the Escape. This system allowed the front wheels to receive 100% of the torque until a slip was detected. Using a Rotary Blade Coupling, the rear wheels could be sent up to 100% of the power in fractions of a second. When switching the system from ``Auto'' to ``On,'' the front and rear axles are locked at a 50/50 split; the reaction time necessary to engage the rear wheels is reduced via an integrated bypass clutch. The Control Trac II system allows for a four-wheel drive vehicle without the use of a center differential. The entire braking system was built by Continental Teves, including the ABS and various related suspension components. CKD production began in 2002 at Ford Lio Ho Motor Co. in Taiwan for various Asian markets. Question: is ford escape a 4 wheel drive vehicle?",

However, whether the stinger falls out on its own depends on the thickness of the victim's skin. In the case of mammals, like humans, with sufficiently thick skin, the stinger typically remains lodged in the skin, tearing loose from the bee's abdomen. This leads to the bee's death in minutes, as mentioned in the passage. So, in the context of mammals, bee stingers do not fall out on their own.

Some other motoring offences (other than parking) can also be dealt with by the issue of FPNs by police, VOSA or local authority personnel.

PCNs are typically associated with parking violations. They are civil notices and are backed with powers to obtain payment through civil action. In this context, they are often used for parking offenses, and they do not result in a criminal prosecution.\n\n2.

FPNs can encompass a wider range of motoring violations, such as speeding or minor traffic infractions. Importantly, FPNs are often associated with a power of criminal prosecution if the penalty specified in the notice is not paid. In some cases, it may be referred to as a \"mitigated penalty\" because paying the fixed penalty avoids criminal prosecution.\n\nSo, a penalty charge notice (PCN) and a fixed penalty notice (FPN) are not the same, as they are used for different types of motoring offenses and have different legal implications.",

In contrast, speed is a scalar quantity that only represents the magnitude of motion without specifying direction.\n\nWhen discussing average velocity, you typically consider the displacement of an object over time.

Dr. Whale asks David if there may be a chance that they could find another portal that could lead them to another world, and hopefully find Dr. Whale's missing brother. Dr. Whale suspects that Regina may have the answer. Meanwhile, Regina is visiting Jiminy Cricket/Dr. Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge) for a series of sessions to let go of using her magic so she can see Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) again. Dr. Whale bursts into Archie's office and confronts Regina during her session to demand that she send him back to his world so he can find his brother. Regina, however, tells Archie that she only brought along whom she wanted, including the body of her beloved Daniel that she preserved with a spell. Later that night, while driving home in the rain, Regina sees whom she believes is Daniel roaming the streets, then finds his glass coffin empty, leading her to believe that Dr. Whale is behind this. As Regina arrives at the hospital to confront the doctor, she sees him on the lab floor with his arm ripped off. Dr. Whale confesses to Regina that he has brought Daniel back, but he has become a ``monster.'' The following morning, David confronts Regina at the hospital; she tells him about what Dr. Whale did, and David reveals that he knows what Snow White/Mary Margaret did to her that started this immense hatred. Regina suggests to David that the resurrected Daniel is reliving his last thoughts and probably has gone to the stables. Unfortunately, Henry is also there, tending to the new horse that David gave him. Question: does daniel come back to life in once upon a time?",

Two shapes of flakes are commercially important. ``Butterfly'' (or ``snowflake'') flakes are irregular in shape and have a number of protruding ``wings''. ``Mushroom'' flakes are largely ball-shaped, with few wings. Butterfly flakes are regarded as having better mouthfeel, with greater tenderness and less noticeable hulls. Mushroom flakes are less fragile than butterfly flakes and are therefore often used for packaged popcorn or confectionery, such as caramel corn. The kernels from a single cob of popcorn may form both butterfly and mushroom flakes; hybrids that produce 100% butterfly flakes or 100% mushroom flakes exist, the latter developed only as recently as 1998. Growing conditions and popping environment can also affect the butterfly-to-mushroom ratio. Question: is popcorn made from corn on the cob?",

Although many diverse species have teeth, their development is largely the same as in humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development.

Primary teeth, also known as baby teeth, start to form in the development of the embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks of gestation.

The arrangement transpired after a bargain for his blood that would cure Damon of the werewolf bite he had received from Tyler. At first, he is reluctant to involve Elena in the rescue attempts, employing Alaric Saltzman, Elena's guardian, instead as Klaus does not know that Elena is alive after the sacrifice which frees Klaus' hybrid side. However, Elena involves herself, desperate to find Stefan. Damon, though hesitant at first, is unable to refuse her because of his love for her. He also points out to her that she once turned back from finding Stefan since she knew Damon would be in danger, clearly showing that she also has feelings for him. He tells her that ``when (he) drag(s) (his) brother from the edge to deliver him back to (her), (he) wants her to remember the things (she) felt while he was gone.'' When Stefan finally returns to Mystic Falls, his attitude is different from that of the first and second seasons. This causes a rift between Elena and Stefan whereas the relationship between Damon and Elena becomes closer and more intimate. A still loyal Elena, however, refuses to admit her feelings for Damon. In 'Dangerous Liaisons', Elena, frustrated with her feelings for him, tells Damon that his love for her may be a problem, and that this could be causing all their troubles. This incenses Damon, causing him to revert to the uncaring and reckless Damon seen in the previous seasons. The rocky relationship between the two continues until the sexual tension hits the fan and in a moment of heated passion, Elena -- for the first time in the three seasons -- kisses Damon of her own accord. This kiss finally causes Elena to admit that she loves both brothers and realize that she must ultimately make her choice as her own ancestress, Katherine Pierce, who turned the brothers, once did. In assessment of her feelings for Damon, she states this: ``Damon just sort of snuck up on me. He got under my skin and no matter what I do, I can't shake him.'' In the season finale, a trip designed to get her to safety forces Elena to make her choice: to go to Damon and possibly see him one last time; or to go to Stefan and her friends and see them one last time. She chooses the latter when she calls Damon to tell him her decision. Damon, who is trying to stop Alaric, accepts what she says and she tells him that maybe if she had met Damon before she had met Stefan, her choice may have been different. This statement causes Damon to remember the first night he did meet Elena which was, in fact, the night her parents died - before she had met Stefan. Not wanting anyone to know he was in town and after giving her some advice about life and love, Damon compels her to forget. He remembers this as he fights Alaric and seems accepting of his death when Alaric, whose life line is tied to Elena's, suddenly collapses in his arms. Damon is grief-stricken, knowing that this means that Elena has also died and yells, ``No! You are not dead!'' A heartbroken Damon then goes to the hospital demanding to see Elena when the doctor, Meredith Fell, tells him that she gave Elena vampire blood.

The toll rates increased to $1.60 for motorcycle, $3.15 for cars, $6.30 for small trucks and $9.45 for large trucks on August 15, 2015. Through increased prices and greater traffic, Transportation Investment Corporation (TI Corp), the public Crown corporation responsible for toll operations on the Port Mann Bridge, forecast its revenue would grow by 85% between fiscal years 2014 and 2017. These fees were assessed using radio-frequency identification (RFID) decals or licence plate photos. A B.C. licensed driver who owes more than $25 in tolls outstanding 90 days is penalized $20 and is unable to purchase vehicle insurance or renew drivers permits without payment of the debt. Out-of-province drivers were also contacted for payment by a US-based contractor. A licence plate processing fee of $2.30 per trip was added to the toll rate for unregistered users who did not pay their toll within seven days of their passage. Monthly passes, which allowed unlimited crossing on the bridge, were available for purchase. Users may have set up an account for online payment of tolls. Users who opted for this method received a decal with an embedded RFID to place on their vehicle's windshield or headlight and avoid paying a processing fee. Tolls were expected to be removed by the year of 2050 or after collecting $3.3 billion. As announced by B.C.

During the 1970s, scrum penalties for feeding the ball into the legs of the second row, packs moving off the ``mark'' or collapsing the scrum were seen as unattractive. The ability of teams to win a game purely on goals from scrum penalties was also seen as unfair. In an effort to improve this situation, changes to rules and their enforcement were made. The number of scrums was reduced with the introduction of the ``handover'' after a team has used a set of six tackles, the differential penalty, one which cannot be kicked at goal was brought in for offences at scrums and referees ceased enforcing some rules regarding feeding the ball into scrum. Aided by this change, it is common for professional teams not to fully contest scrums, according to their choice of tactics. Question: can you contest a scrum in rugby league?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nIn rugby league, there have been significant changes to scrum rules and enforcement over the years. As mentioned in the passage, during the 1970s, there were issues with scrum penalties, and various changes were made to address these concerns. One of these changes was the introduction of the \"handover\" after a team has used a set of six tackles, which essentially means that after a certain number of tackles, possession of the ball is handed over to the opposing team, and a scrum is not formed. \n\nAdditionally, the passage notes that it is common for professional teams not to fully contest scrums according to their choice of tactics. This means that teams may choose not to engage fully in a scrum and may opt for other strategies instead. \n\nSo, in modern rugby league, scrums are not contested in the same way as in rugby union.

The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage.

A pig side has 15 to 16 ribs (depending on the breed), but usually two or three are left on the shoulder when it is separated from the loin. So, a rack of back ribs contains a minimum of eight ribs (some may be trimmed if damaged), but can include up to 13 ribs, depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher.

Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but by 1075 William's hold on England was mostly secure, allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent. Question: did william the conqueror have a legitimate claim to the english throne?",
        "pred_ans": "Based on the provided passage, it can be inferred that William the Conqueror believed he had a legitimate claim to the English throne. He argued that Edward the Confessor had promised him the throne and that Harold Godwinson had sworn to support his claim. However, the question of whether his claim was indeed legitimate is a matter of historical debate and interpretation. The legitimacy of claims to thrones in medieval Europe often involved complex political, legal, and dynastic factors. Therefore, it's not possible to definitively determine the legitimacy of William's claim solely based on the information in the passage.",

        "question": "Passage: Flat feet (also called pes planus or fallen arches) is a postural deformity in which the arches of the foot collapse, with the entire sole of the foot coming into complete or near-complete contact with the ground. An estimated 20--30% of the general population have an arch that simply never develops in one or both feet. Question: are flat feet the same as fallen arches?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nFlat feet and fallen arches are related but not exactly the same. The passage correctly defines flat feet as a postural deformity in which the arches of the foot collapse, causing the entire sole of the foot to come into complete or near-complete contact with the ground. This implies that flat feet refer to the condition where the arches are not present or significantly lowered.\n\nOn the other hand, fallen arches specifically describe the situation where arches that were once present have collapsed or flattened over time. In other words, fallen arches are a subset of flat feet, where the arches were initially developed but have since \"fallen.\"\n\nSo, while someone with fallen arches has flat feet, not all individuals with flat feet necessarily have fallen arches. Therefore, the statement that flat feet are the same as fallen arches is false.",
