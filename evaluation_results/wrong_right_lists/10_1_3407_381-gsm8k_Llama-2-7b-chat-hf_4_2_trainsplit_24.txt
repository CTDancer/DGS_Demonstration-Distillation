        "question": "Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?",
        "pred_ans": "Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculating the Number of Soda Bottles:** Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find out how many bottles he needs, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between bottles:\n   \n   Number of soda bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet/bottle = 8 bottles\n\n2. **Time to Move Between Bottles:** Richard takes 5 seconds to move from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy in.\n\n3. **Total Time:** Now, we need to find out how much time it will take for Richard to go through all the bottles. Since he spends 5 seconds for each bottle, and there are 8 bottles in total:\n\n   Total time = 5 seconds/bottle * 8 bottles = 40 seconds\n\nTherefore the answer is: Richard will take a total of 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains by placing the candy in each bottle.",
        "ground_truth": "35",
        "score": "The student's answer appears to be correct. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. They correctly calculate the number of soda bottles needed based on the width of the driveway, which is 24 feet wide, and the desired spacing between bottles, which is 3 feet. They correctly find that there are 8 bottles needed (24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles).\n\n2. They correctly state that Richard takes 5 seconds to move from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy in.\n\n3. They correctly calculate the total time it will take for Richard to go through all the bottles by multiplying the time per bottle (5 seconds) by the number of bottles (8 bottles). This results in a total time of 40 seconds.\n\nTherefore the score is: 100"

        "question": "Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.  They are currently on sale for buy one get one free.  She also has a $2.00 coupon.  How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?",
        "pred_ans": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Each pack contains 4 razors, and the cost per pack is $4.00.\n2. The razors are on a \"buy one get one free\" sale. This means that for every pack Heather buys, she gets one pack for free.\n3. Heather also has a $2.00 coupon.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for 2 packs of razors:\n\n- Cost of 2 packs before discount: 2 packs * $4.00/pack = $8.00\n\nSince it's a \"buy one get one free\" sale, Heather will pay for one pack and get the second one for free. This effectively means she's getting a 50% discount.\n\n- Total cost after the \"buy one get one free\" discount: $8.00 / 2 = $4.00\n\nNow, let's subtract the $2.00 coupon from the total cost:\n\n- Final cost after applying the $2.00 coupon: $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00\n\nSince there are 4 razors in each pack, and Heather is buying 2 packs, she will have a total of 8 razors.\n\n- Cost per individual razor in cents: $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25\n\nTo express the cost in cents, we can multiply by 100:\n\n- Cost per individual razor in cents: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents\n\nTherefore the answer is: Each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount if Heather buys 2 packs of razors.",
        "ground_truth": "25",
        "score": "The student's answer is mostly correct in its approach and calculations. Let's analyze the answer step by step:\n\n1. They correctly mention that each pack contains 4 razors and costs $4.00.\n2. They understand the \"buy one get one free\" concept and apply it properly.\n3. They correctly account for the $2.00 coupon.\n\nThe calculation of the total cost before discount, the discount itself, and the application of the coupon is accurate.\n\nHowever, there is a slight mistake in the calculation of the final cost after applying the coupon. They subtract $2.00 from $4.00 and state that the final cost is $2.00, which is not correct. The final cost after the coupon should be $2.00 + $2.00 = $4.00.\n\nThen, they proceed to calculate the cost per individual razor in cents correctly, which is $0.25.\n\nThe explanation and steps provided are clear and well-organized, making it easy to understand the solution.\n\nConsidering the minor error in the final calculation, I would score this answer as follows:\n\nScore: 95"
