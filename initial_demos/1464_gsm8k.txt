User: Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour. Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?
Response: First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = 200 hours. Then calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * $15/hour = $3000. Then multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $3000/worker * 4 workers = $12,000. Now multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * $20/hour = $4,000. Now multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $4,000/manager * 2 managers = $8,000. Now add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $8,000 + $12,000 = $20,000. Now multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $20,000 * .1 = $2,000. Now add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $2,000 + $20,000 = $22,000. Therefore the answer is 22000
User: Ellie went to visit a circus with Sarah and they both got lost in the house of mirrors. They have to travel through the house of mirrors a few times before they finally get out and when they leave, they discuss how many times they've seen their own reflections. Sarah says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 10 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors, she saw her reflection 5 times. Ellie says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 6 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors she saw her reflection 3 times. They both passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times each and they both passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times each. In total, how many times did Sarah and Ellie see their reflections?
Response: In the rooms with tall mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 10 reflections * 3 passes = 30 times. In the rooms with wide mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of 5 reflections * 5 passes = 25 reflections. So Sarah saw her reflection a total of 30 + 25 = 55 times. In the rooms with tall mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of 6 reflections * 3 passes = 18 times. In the rooms with wide mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of 3 reflections * 5 passes = 15 times. So Ellie saw her reflection a total of 18 + 15 = 33 times. Therefore, Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections a total of 55 + 33 = 88 times. Therefore the answer is 88
User: A curry house sells curries that have varying levels of spice. Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?
Response: The curry house previously bought 3 peppers per very spicy curry * 30 very spicy curries = 90 peppers for very spicy curries. They also bought 2 peppers per spicy curry * 30 spicy curries = 60 peppers for spicy curries. They also bought 1 pepper per mild curry * 10 mild curries = 10 peppers for mild curries. So they were previously buying 90 + 60 + 10 = 160 peppers. They now buy 2 peppers per spicy curry * 15 spicy curries = 30 peppers for spicy curries. They also now buy 1 pepper per mild curry * 90 mild curries = 90 peppers for mild curries. So they now buy 30 + 90 = 120 peppers. This is a difference of 160 peppers bought originally - 120 peppers bought now = 40 peppers. Therefore the answer is 40
User: Peggy is moving and is looking to get rid of her record collection. Sammy says that he will buy all of them for 4 dollars each. Bryan is only interested in half of the records but will offer 6 dollars each for the half that he is interested in and 1 dollar each for the remaining half that he is not interested in with the hopes that he can resell them in bulk later. If Peggy has 200 records, what is the difference in profit between Sammy versus Bryan's deal?
Response: Sammy is offering to take the whole collection of 200 records and pay Peggy 4 dollars each for them which would net Peggy 200 * 4=800 dollars for her entire record collection. Bryan is willing to buy Peggy's entire record collection but at two different price points, half at one point and half at another. Half of Peggy's record collection is 200/2=100, which means that 100 records will sell for one price and 100 records will sell for another price. Bryan is willing to pay more for the half of the record collection that he is interested in so Peggy would net 100 * 6=600 dollars for the first half of her record collection. For the half of the collection that Bryan is just planning on reselling at a later date, he is willing to offer Peggy 100 *1=100 dollars to take off of her hands. In total Bryan is willing to offer Peggy 600+100=700 dollars for her entire record collection. If Sammy is offering 800 dollars to buy Peggy's entire record collection and Bryan is offering 700 dollars for Peggy's entire record collection, then Peggy's net profit would be 800-700=100 dollars more by taking Sammy's deal instead of Bryan's deal. Therefore the answer is 100
