User: An elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class.  She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?
Response: Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $7. Similarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $10. Therefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $17. Therefore the answer is 17
User: TreShaun's full marker has enough ink in it to paint three 4 inch by 4 inch squares. If he colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles, what percentage of ink is left?
Response: Each 4 by 4 square equals 16 square inches because 4 x 4 = 16. Three squares equals 48 square inches because 3 x 16 = 48. Each rectangle uses 12 square inches because 2 x 6 = 12. Both rectangles will use 24 square inches because 2 x 12 = 24. He has 1/2 of the ink left because 24 / 48 = 1/2. He has 50% of the ink left because 1/2 x 100 = 50. Therefore the answer is 50
User: For every loaf of bread that Ted buys, he needs an additional 2 packs of sandwich meat and 2 packs of sliced cheese to make 10 sandwiches.  The bread costs $4.00, the sandwich meat costs $5.00 per pack and the cheese costs $4.00 per pack.  He has a $1.00 off  coupon for one pack of cheese and an additional $1.00 coupon for one pack of meat.  How much does each sandwich cost?
Response: He buys 2 packs of sandwich meat at $5.00 a pack so 2*5.00 = $10.00. He buys 2 packs of cheese at $4.00 a pack so 2*4.00 = $8.00. The loaf of bread cost $4.00 plus $10.00 for meat and $8.00 for cheese so his total is 4+10+8 = $22.00. He has coupons to use a checkout so his new total is 22-1-1 = $20.00. He can make 10 sandwiches from his purchase and his purchase total is $20 so 20/10 = $2.00. Therefore the answer is 2
User: Sofia and her mother go to the grocery store and buys 10kgs of oranges to be used in their home for the week. While at the store, Sofia's father calls and says they're to add 5 more kgs since their neighbor also wanted some supplies. When they reach home, they estimated that for the next coming two weeks they'll have to buy twice as many oranges each week for the supplies to be enough. What the total quantity of oranges they would have bought after the three weeks.
Response: For the first week, they bought 10 + 5 = 15kgs. For the next week, they bought twice the quantity of oranges which is 2*15 = 30kgs. For the next two weeks, the total quantity of oranges bought is 30*2 = 60 kgs. The total quantity for the three weeks is 60+15=75 kgs. Therefore the answer is 75
User: In a spelling contest held in her school, Drew got 20 questions correct, winning her the competition. She got six questions wrong, and her competitor Carla got 14 questions correct, and twice as many questions wrong as the number of questions Drew got wrong. If each competitor was asked a different question, how many questions were asked in the competition?
Response: Since Drew got 20 questions right and 6 wrong, she was asked 20+6 = 26 questions. Carla got twice as many questions wrong as Drew got, a total of 2*6 = 12 questions wrong. The total number of questions that Carla was asked is 12+14 = 26. Altogether, there were 26+26 = 52 questions that were asked in the contest. Therefore the answer is 52
User: Two teams are playing in a stadium with a capacity of 2000 people. The total number of people in the stadium is 3/4 of the total capacity and each person paid $20 in entry fees. What is the difference between the total amount of fees collected when the stadium was 3/4 full and if the stadium would have been full?
Response: When the stadium is full, the total fees charged is 2000*$20 = $40000. When the stadium is 3/4 full, the total number of people in is 3/4*2000 = 1500 people. The total entry fees collected when the stadium is 3/4 full is 1500*$20 = $30000. The difference in the total entry fees when the stadium is full and when it's 3/4 full is $40000-$30000 = $10000. Therefore the answer is 10000
User: Edmund owns a gift wrapping shop, he uses 18 inches of gift wrapper per gift box. If Edmund has 90 inches of gift wrapper per day, how many gift boxes will he be able to wrap every 3 days?
