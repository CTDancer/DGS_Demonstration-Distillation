User: Edmund is buying a new computer and needs to save up $75 before he has enough. He convinces his parents to pay him for extra chores. He normally has to do 12 chores a week. His parents agree to pay him $2 for every extra chore he does during the week. If he does 4 chores a day for two weeks, how much does he earn?
Response: In two weeks, he has to do 24 chores because 2 x 12 = 24. He now does 28 chores a week because 7 x 4 = 28. He does 56 chores in two weeks because 2 x 28 = 56. He has done 32 extra chores because 56 - 24 = 32. He earns $64 because 2 x 32 = 64. Therefore the answer is 64
User: In a single day, it rained for many hours. From 2pm to 4pm, it rained at a rate of 4 inches per hour.  From 4pm to 7pm, it rained at a rate of 3 inches per hour.  And from 7pm to 9pm, it rained at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour.  If the rain gauge started out the day already containing 2 inches of rainwater, how many inches of water will the gauge contain at 9pm?
Response: From 2pm to 4pm is 4-2=2 hours. Thus, from 2-4pm, raining at 4 inches per hour, it added 8 inches to the rain gauge. From 4pm to 7pm is 7-4=3 hours. Thus, from 4-7pm, raining at a rate of 3 inches per hour, it added 3*3=9 inches to the rain gauge. From 7pm to 9pm is 9-7=2 hours. Thus, from 7-9pm, raining at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour, it added 2*0.5=1 inch to the gauge. If the gauge originally contained 2 inches of water, by 9pm the gauge contained 2+8+9+1=20 inches of water. Therefore the answer is 20
User: A new book sold 15 copies at the bookstore on Wednesday. On Thursday the book sold three times that many copies. On Friday the book sold one-fifth the number of copies it did on Thursday. How many copies of the book did the bookstore sell by Friday?

User: Megan is making food for a party.  She has to spend 20 minutes preparing one dish in the oven.  Each dish can feed 5 people.  She spends 2 hours preparing as many of these dishes as she can for the party.  How many people can she feed with these dishes?
Response: First, we need to determine the total amount of minutes available for cooking. We do this by performing 2*60=120, as there are 60 minutes in an hour. Now that we know we have 120 minutes, we then divide the preparation time into the total amount of time by performing 120/20= 6 dishes capable of being made. Since each dish can feed 5 people, we find the total number of people fed by performing 5*6=30 people. Therefore the answer is 30
User: Kim drives 30 miles to her friend's house.  On the way back she has to take a detour that is 20% longer.  She spends 30 minutes at her friend's house.  She drives at a speed of 44 mph.  How long did she spend away from home?
Response: The trip back was 30*.2=6 miles longer than the trip there. So it was 30+6=36 miles. So the total drive was 30+36=66 miles. That means she drove for 66/44=1.5 hours. She stayed with her friend 30/60=.5 hours. So the total time was 1.5+.5=2 hours. Therefore the answer is 2
User: Bea's mom planted 50 Mahogany and 30 Narra trees on their farm. Due to a typhoon, a total of 5 trees fell. One more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell. A month after the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as much as the number of the Narra and thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell. How many trees are now on the farm?
Response: Before the typhoon, their farm had a total of 50 trees + 30 trees = 80 trees. If there was 1 more than Mahogany than Narra tree that fell, then this means there were 2 Narra trees and 2 + 1 = 3 Mahogany trees that fell during the typhoon. So, Bea's mom planted 2 trees x 2 = 4 Narra trees. She also planted 3 trees x 3 = 9 Mahogany trees. So, her mom planted 4 trees + 9 trees = 13 more trees. After the typhoon, they only had 80 trees - 5 trees = 75 trees left. Therefore, there are 75 trees + 13 trees = 88 trees now. Therefore the answer is 88
User: During a school meeting, 300 students and 30 teachers are seated but 25 students are standing. How many attended the school meeting?
