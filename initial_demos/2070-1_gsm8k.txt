User: There were 25 peaches in each basket. Five baskets of peaches were delivered to a market. The farmers have eaten 5 peaches. The remaining peaches are packed into smaller boxes of 15 each. How many boxes of peaches are there?

User: Marcus is making calzones. It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?
Response: First find the amount of time it takes Marcus to saute the garlic and peppers: 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes. Then find the dough's resting time: 30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes. Then add the kneading and resting time to find the total dough time: 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes. Then multiply that amount by 1/10th to find the assembly time: 90 minutes / 10 = 9 minutes. Then add the saute time, knead time, rest time and assembly time to find the total time Marcus spends on the calzones: 9 minutes + 20 minutes + 5 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 124 minutes. Therefore the answer is 124

User: The county fair was hosting a pumpkin contest to see who could grow the biggest pumpkin in pounds.  Brad entered his pumpkin with a weight of 54 pounds.  Jessica's was half the weight of Brad's.  Betty's pumpkin weight 4 times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin.  What is the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin in  pounds?
Response: Jessica's pumpkin weighs half the weight of Brad's 54-pound pumpkin so 54/2 = 27 pounds. Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the amount of Jessica's 27-pound pumpkin so it weighs 4*27 = 108. Betty has the heaviest pumpkin at 108 pounds while Jessica's is the lowest at 27 pounds so the difference is 108-27 =81 pounds. Therefore the answer is 81
User: John's new computer cost $1500.  He needs to get a monitor and other peripherals that cost 1/5 that much.  He also wants to upgrade the $300 video card in the base computer with one that costs twice as much.  How much did he spend?
Response: The peripherals cost 1500/5=$300. The video card cost 300*2=$600. So it cost 600-300=$300 more. That means the total cost was 1500+300+300=$2100. Therefore the answer is 2100
User: Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute.  Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her.  After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?
Response: Robert coughs twice as much as Georgia who coughs 5 times so Robert coughs 2*5 = 10 coughs per minute. Georgia coughs 5 times and Robert coughs 10 times so together they cough 5+10 = 15 times per minute. After 20 minutes they will have coughed 15*20 = 300 coughs. Therefore the answer is 300
