User: Uncle Bradley has a $1000 bill that he wants to change into smaller bills so he could give them to his nieces and nephews. He wants to change 3/10 of the money into $50 bills while the rest into $100 bills. How many pieces of bills will Uncle Bradley have in all?
Response: There will be $1000 x 3/10 = $300 worth of money that will be changed into $50 bills. Uncle Bradley will have $300/$50 = 6 pieces of $50 bills. He will change $1000 - $300 = $700 worth of money into $100 bills. So there will be $700/$100 = 7 pieces of $100 bills. Thus, there will be a total of 6 + 7 = 13 pieces of $50 and $100 bills in all. Therefore the answer is 13
User: Leo had 400 marbles in a jar. He packed the marbles with ten marbles in each pack, and he gave some of them to his two friends,  Manny and Neil.   He gave Manny 1/4 of the number of packs of marbles, Neil received 1/8 of the number of packs of marbles, and he kept the rest. How many packs of marbles did Leo keep?
Response: Leo had 400/10 = 40 packs of marbles. He gave Manny 1/4 x 40 = 10 packs of marbles. And, Neil received 1/8 x 40 = 5 packs of marbles. Thus, Leo. gave a total of 10 + 5 = 15 packs of marbles. Therefore, Leo kept 40 - 15 = 25 packs of marbles. Therefore the answer is 25

User: Last month, a factory made 12000 dolls and their associated accessories.  The accessories for each doll included 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats.  If each doll took 45 seconds to make and each accessory took 10 seconds to make, what was the total combined machine operation time, in seconds, required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories?
Response: The number of shoes the factory made was 12000 dolls x 2 shoes/doll = 24000 shoes. The factory also made for each doll 12000 dolls x 3 bags/doll = 36000 bags. The set of cosmetics made for each doll was just one, so there are 12000 cosmetics sets. Finally, the number of hats for the dolls was 12000 dolls x 5 hats/doll = 60000 hats. In total, the number of accessories was 24000 + 36000 + 12000 + 60000 = 132000 accessories. The dolls took in total 12000 dolls x 45 seconds/doll = 540000 seconds to be made. All the accessories also took 132000 accessories x 10 seconds/accessory = 1320000 seconds. Combing both results, we have that the total time the machinery was working was 1320000 + 540000 = 1860000 seconds. Therefore the answer is 1860000
