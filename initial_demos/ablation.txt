User: A banana plantation on Jakies Island can produce ten times as many bananas as a banana plantation on a nearby island. If the banana plantation on the nearby island produced 9000 bananas in a year, what's the total banana produce from the two islands that year?
Response: Jakies island produced ten times as many bananas as the nearby island, a total of 10*9000 = 90000 bananas. Together, the two islands produced 90000+9000= 99000 bananas in that year. Therefore the answer is 99000

User: Elisa and her two friends went out to dinner. Each of them ordered a meal worth $10. Afterwards, they each had a scoop of the same kind of ice cream. If the $45 Elisa had was enough to pay for everything, what was the cost of a scoop of ice cream?
Response: The three friends had meals worth 10 * 3 = 30 dollars. If they paid for the meals only, they would have remained with 45 - 30 = 15 dollars. Dividing the remaining amount by the number of ice cream scoops gives 15/3 = 5 dollars. Each scoop of ice cream cost 5 dollars. Therefore the answer is 5
