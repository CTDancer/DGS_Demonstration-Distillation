User: There were 25 peaches in each basket. Five baskets of peaches were delivered to a market. The farmers have eaten 5 peaches. The remaining peaches are packed into smaller boxes of 15 each. How many boxes of peaches are there?
Response: The total number of peaches delivered to a market was 5 x 25 = 125. The remaining peaches after 5 were eaten was 150 - 5 = 145. So, there are 120/15 = 8 smaller boxes of peaches. Therefore the answer is 8

User: Marcus is making calzones. It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?
Response: First find the amount of time it takes Marcus to saute the garlic and peppers: 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes. Then find the dough's resting time: 30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes. Then add the kneading and resting time to find the total dough time: 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes. Then multiply that amount by 1/10th to find the assembly time: 90 minutes / 10 = 9 minutes. Then add the saute time, knead time, rest time and assembly time to find the total time Marcus spends on the calzones: 9 minutes + 20 minutes + 5 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 124 minutes. Therefore the answer is 124
User: James decides to buy himself a new barbell.  It cost 30% more than his old $250 barbell.  How much did it cost?

User: The county fair was hosting a pumpkin contest to see who could grow the biggest pumpkin in pounds.  Brad entered his pumpkin with a weight of 54 pounds.  Jessica's was half the weight of Brad's.  Betty's pumpkin weight 4 times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin.  What is the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin in  pounds?
Response: Jessica's pumpkin weighs half the weight of Brad's 54-pound pumpkin so 54/2 = 27 pounds. Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the amount of Jessica's 27-pound pumpkin so it weighs 4*27 = 108. Betty has the heaviest pumpkin at 108 pounds while Jessica's is the lowest at 27 pounds so the difference is 108-27 =81 pounds. Therefore the answer is 81
User: John's new computer cost $1500.  He needs to get a monitor and other peripherals that cost 1/5 that much.  He also wants to upgrade the $300 video card in the base computer with one that costs twice as much.  How much did he spend?
Response: The peripherals cost 1500/5=$300. The video card cost 300*2=$600. So it cost 600-300=$300 more. That means the total cost was 1500+300+300=$2100. Therefore the answer is 2100
User: Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute.  Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her.  After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?
Response: Robert coughs twice as much as Georgia who coughs 5 times so Robert coughs 2*5 = 10 coughs per minute. Georgia coughs 5 times and Robert coughs 10 times so together they cough 5+10 = 15 times per minute. After 20 minutes they will have coughed 15*20 = 300 coughs. Therefore the answer is 300
User: Justice has 3 ferns, 5 palms, and 7 succulent plants in her house. If she wants a total of 24 plants in her home, how many more plants does she need?

User: Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the childrenâ€™s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Response: The tickets for both of her brothers will cost her $10 * 2 = $20. To buy tickets for all of them, it will cost Isabelle $20 + $20 = $40. Between all of them, they have saved a total of $5 + $5 = $10. Since they have already saved $10, she needs to earn an additional $40 - $10 = $30 to afford the tickets. Since she makes $3 per week, it will take her $30 / ($3/week) = 10 weeks to save enough money for all of the tickets. Therefore the answer is 10
User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?

User: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, with both costing $20 each. If she got a 20% discount on the pencils and bought 100 cucumbers, calculate the total amount she spent to buy the items.
Response: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, meaning she bought 100/2 = 50 pencils. The total cost for purchasing the pencils without the discount is 50*$20 = $1000. At a 20% discount, Isabela paid 20/100*$1000 = $200 less. The total amount of money she used to buy the pencils is $1000-$200 = $800. She also bought the cucumbers at a total cost of $20*100=$2000. The total cost for the items is $2000+$800= $2800. Therefore the answer is 2800

User: Tony is driving his car between his town and a friend's down. The towns are 120 miles apart and he gets there in 3 hours. The next day, he is driving to see another friend who lives 200 miles away from his friend. If he drives at the same speed, how long will the drive take?
Response: He is driving 40 MPH because 120 / 3 = 40. It will take him 5 hours because 200 / 40 = 5. Therefore the answer is 5
User: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?

User: Jenna's doctor tells her that she should tan no more than 200 minutes a month. If she tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week for the first two weeks of the month, how many minutes can she tan in the last two weeks of the month?
Response: First find how many minutes Jenna tans each of the first two weeks: 30 minutes/day * 2 days/week = 60 minutes/week. Then multiply that number by the number of weeks to find how many minutes Jenna tans in the first half of the month: 60 minutes/week * 2 weeks = 120 minutes. Then subtract that time from the total time Jenna can spend tanning to find how many more minutes she can tan: 200 minutes - 120 minutes = 80 minutes. Therefore the answer is 80
