User: Debelyn, Christel, and Andrena collect dolls. Debelyn had 20 dolls before she gave Andrena 2 dolls. Christel had 24 dolls before giving Andrena 5 dolls. After all the gifts, Andrena now has 2 more dolls  than Christel, how many more dolls does andrena have now than Debelyn?
Response: Debelyn had 20 - 2 = 18 dolls left after giving out 2 dolls to Christel. Christel had 24 + 2 = 26 dolls after receiving 2 dolls from Debelyn. Christel had 24 - 5 = 19 dolls after giving Andrena 5 dolls. So, Andrena has 19 +2 = 21 dolls now. Therefore, Andrena has 21 - 18 = 3 more dolls than Debelyn. Therefore the answer is 3
User: Ezekiel hikes as a hobby. This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?
Response: After the first day, Ezekiel had 50 - 10 = 40 kilometers of the hike left. On the second day, he covered 50 / 2 = 25 kilometers. Therefore, on the third day, he had 40 - 25 = 15 kilometers left to finish the hike. Therefore the answer is 15
User: Lucille has to divide the revenue from her business in the ratio of 4:11 for employee salaries and stock purchases, respectively. If she has $3000 as her revenue, calculate the total amount of money she spends on employee salary?

User: James watched 2 episodes of Jeopardy and 2 episodes of Wheel of Fortune.  Jeopardy is 20 minutes and Wheel of Fortune is twice as long.  How many hours did he watch TV?
Response: He watched 2*20=40 minutes of Jeopardy. Wheel of Fortune is 2*20=40 minutes each. So he watched it for 40*2=80 minutes. So he watched 40+80=120 minutes of TV. That means he watched 120/60=2 hours of TV. Therefore the answer is 2
User: A fast-food chain offers free delivery for a minimum purchase of $18. Danny ordered 2 quarter-pounder burgers for $3.20 each, 2 large fries that cost $1.90 each, and 2 milkshakes that cost $2.40 each. How much more worth of food should he order to avail of the free delivery?
Response: Two quarter-pounder burgers cost $3.20 x 2 = $6.40. Two large fries cost $1.90 x 2 = $3.80. Two milkshakes cost $2.40 x 2 = $4.80. The total amount spent for the burgers, fries, and shakes is $6.40 + $3.80 + $4.80 = $15. Therefore, he should order $18 - $15 = $3 worth of additional food to take advantage of the free food delivery. Therefore the answer is 3

User: Kimberly went strawberry picking with her family over the weekend. She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked and her parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. If her brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, how many strawberries would they each have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them?
Response: Kimberly's brother picked 3 x 15 = 45 strawberries. Kimberly picked 8 x 45 = 360 strawberries. Kimberly's parents picked 360 - 93 = 267 strawberries. Altogether, they picked 45 + 360 + 267 = 672 strawberries. Each of them will have 672/4 = 168 strawberries. Therefore the answer is 168
User: Teresa scored 70 marks in science, 80 in music, 85 in social studies, and the physics exam, which was the hardest test that Teresa had ever taken in her entire life, she scored half as many marks as she scored in music. Calculate the total marks Teresa scored in all the subjects.
Response: The total marks of science and music are 70+80 = 150. When you add the marks she scored in social studies, the full marks become 150+85 = 235. She scored half as many marks in physics as she scored music, totaling 1/2*80 = 40 marks. When you add the marks she scored in physics to the total marks of the other subjects, the full marks become 235+40 = 275. Therefore the answer is 275
User: It starts raining at 7:00 and pours heavily until its stops at 17:00  on a particular day. On the second day, the rain takes 2 more hours than it took on the first day to stop. On the third day, the rain pours for twice the amount of time it took on the second day. Calculate the total time it was raining in the three days.
Response: On the first day, it rained for 17:00 - 7:00 = 10 hours. On the second day, it 10 hours + 2 hours = 12 hours for the rain to stop. It rained for 2 * 12 hours = 24 hours on the third day. In the three days, it was raining for 24 hours + 12 hours + 10 hours = 46 hours. Therefore the answer is 46
User: Opal won $100.00 betting on a horse race.  She put half of her winnings into savings and bet the other half of her winnings.  This time, she made a 60% profit and again, put half of her earnings into savings.  How much did she put into her savings?
Response: She won $100.00 and put half into savings so she put 100/2 = $50.00 into savings. She won $100.00 and put $50.00 into savings so that leaves 100-50 = $50.00 to bet. She bet $50.00 and made a 60% profit so her profit was 50*.60 = $30.00. The total wins in the second bet are 30+50 = $80. She put half of her $80.00 earnings into savings so that's 80/2 = $40.00 into savings. She put $50.00 into saving from her 1st bet and $40.00 from her second so she has saved 50+40 = $90.00. Therefore the answer is 90
