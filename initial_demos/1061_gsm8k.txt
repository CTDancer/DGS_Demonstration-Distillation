User: Darius, Matt, and Marius are friends, who played table football. During all the games they played, Marius scored 3 points more than Darius, and Darius scored 5 points less than Matt. How many points did all three friends score together, if Darius scored 10 points?
Response: If Darius scored 10 points, then Marius scored 10 + 3 = 13 points in total. Darius scored 5 points less than Matt, so Matt scored 10 + 5 = 15 points in total. So all three friends gathered 13 + 15 + 10 = 38 points. Therefore the answer is 38
User: A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity. If there were 50 people at the next pick-up point, how many people could not take the bus because it was full?
Response: At the first pick-up point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity, a total of 3/5*80 = 48. The available seats in the bus after the first pick up point is 80-48 = 32. If there were 50 people in the second pick-up station, and only 32 sits were available, the number of people who did not take the bus because it was full is 50-32=18. Therefore the answer is 18
User: James takes up dancing for fitness.  He loses twice as many calories per hour as he did when he was walking.  He dances twice a day for .5 hours each time and he does this 4 times a week.  He burned 300 calories an hour walking.  How many calories does he lose a week from dancing?
Response: He burns 2*300=600 calories an hour. He dances for .5*2=1 hour per day. So he burns 600*1=600 calories per day. So he burns 600*4=2400 calories per week. Therefore the answer is 2400
User: Happy Cattle Ranch is home to 200 cows. Every year, the mother cows have enough calves that the number of cows the rancher owns rises by half the number of cows living on the ranch. If the rancher does not buy or sell any cows, how many cows will the rancher own on Happy Cattle Ranch in two years?
Response: In one year, the rancher will have 200 + 200/2 = 200 + 100 = 300 cows. In two years, the rancher will have 300 + 300/2 = 300 + 150 = 450 cows. Therefore the answer is 450
User: Lilia has 15 peaches. She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each, while 4 other peaches were sold to her relatives for $1.25 each, and she left the other one for herself. How much did she earn after selling 14 peaches?
Response: Lilia earned 10 x $2 = $20 for selling the peaches to her friends. She also earned 4 x $1.25 = $5 for selling the peaches to her relatives. Therefore, Lilia earned $20 + $5 = $25 for selling 14 peaches. Therefore the answer is 25
User: Out of the 150 students, 60% are girls and the rest are boys. Only 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs. How many of the boys did not join varsity clubs?
Response: Out of the 150 students, 100% - 60% = 40% are boys. So, there are 150 x 40/100 = 60 boys. Out of the 60 boys, 60 x 1/3 = 20 joined varsity clubs. Therefore, 60 - 20 = 40 boys did not join varsity clubs. Therefore the answer is 40
