User: Mark wants to order a pair of slippers for his wife with her initials embroidered on top.  The slippers are currently $50.00 and are 10% off.  The embroidery will be $5.50 per shoe and shipping is a flat rate of $10.00.  How much will the slippers cost?
Response: The slippers are $50.00 and currently 10% off so thatâ€™s 50*.10 = $5.00 discount. The slippers are $50.00 with a $5.00 discount which makes them 50-5 = $45.00. The embroidery will be $5.50 per shoe, and 2 shoes make a pair so it will cost 5.50*2 = $11.00. The shoes are on sale for $45.00, the embroidery will be $11.00 and the shipping is $10.00 for a total of 45+11+10 = $66.00. Therefore the answer is 66
User: Mary and Ann are going sledding. Mary slides down a hill that's 630 feet long at a speed of 90 feet/minute. Ann slides down a hill that's 800 feet long at a rate of 40 feet/minute. How much longer does Ann's trip take than Mary?
Response: First find the total time Mary's trip takes: 630 feet / 90 feet/minute = 7 minutes. Then find the total time Ann's trip takes: 800 feet / 40 feet/minute = 20 minutes. Then subtract Mary's time from Ann's time to find the difference: 20 minutes - 7 minutes = 13 minutes. Therefore the answer is 13
User: Julie, Letitia and Anton decided to have dinner together at a nearby restaurant.  Julie orders $10 worth of food, Letitia orders $20 worth of food, and Anton orders $30 worth of food.  How much should each pay in tips if they want to split a 20% tip for the whole meal evenly?
Response: First, we need to determine how much the entire meal costs before we can determine the tip. We perform 10+20+30=60 dollars worth of food. Now we need to find out how much the total tip to be paid is, by multiplying 60*.2=12 dollars in tips. Since they want to split this evenly amongst three people, this works out to 12/3= 4 dollars in tips per person. Therefore the answer is 4
