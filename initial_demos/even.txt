User: Sam works at the Widget Factory, assembling Widgets. He can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes. Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together 2 complete widgets every 15 minutes. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for 6 hours before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for 4 hours before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift. At the end of the day, they had completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?
Response: Sam completes a widget every 10 minutes. When Jack helps they finish 2 in 15 minutes. Sam has finished 1 widget and has begun working on another one, and Jack finishes the second one at 15 minutes. So it takes Jack 15 minutes to complete a widget. Sam worked for 6 hours yesterday, so he was able to complete 6 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 10 minutes per widget = 36 widgets. Jack worked for 4 hours, so he was able to complete 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15 minutes per widget = 16 widgets. Sam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete 68 widgets together. So of those, Tony personally completed 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = 16 widgets. It took Tony 8 hours to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 16 widgets = 30 minutes per widget. Therefore the answer is 30
User: A curry house sells curries that have varying levels of spice. Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?
Response: The curry house previously bought 3 peppers per very spicy curry * 30 very spicy curries = 90 peppers for very spicy curries. They also bought 2 peppers per spicy curry * 30 spicy curries = 60 peppers for spicy curries. They also bought 1 pepper per mild curry * 10 mild curries = 10 peppers for mild curries. So they were previously buying 90 + 60 + 10 = 160 peppers. They now buy 2 peppers per spicy curry * 15 spicy curries = 30 peppers for spicy curries. They also now buy 1 pepper per mild curry * 90 mild curries = 90 peppers for mild curries. So they now buy 30 + 90 = 120 peppers. This is a difference of 160 peppers bought originally - 120 peppers bought now = 40 peppers. Therefore the answer is 40
User: Alec is running for Class President. He thinks that if he can get three-quarters of the class to vote for him then there is no chance anyone else can beat him. Half of the class have already said they will vote for him but out of the remaining students, only 5 have said they are thinking about voting for him. He surveys the students who are thinking about voting for someone else, and changes his flyers to reflect the issues these students are concerned about. This results in a fifth of these students saying they'll vote for him. If Alec's class has 60 students and everyone who said they will vote for him does so, how many more votes does Alec need to reach his goal number of votes?
Response: To calculate Alec's goal number of votes, we need to know that 60 students / 4 = 15 students is equal to one-quarter of the class students. Alec's goal is therefore 15 students * 3 quarters = 45 votes. Half of the class said they will vote for him, so there are already 60 students / 2 = 30 votes. Another 5 students are thinking about voting for him which leaves a total so far of 30 + 5 = 35 votes. This means there are 60 students - 35 voting for Alec = 25 students not voting for Alec. A fifth of these decided to vote, so this is a further 25 students / 5 = 5 votes. Alec is therefore receiving a total of 35 + 5 = 40 votes. So he has missed his goal by 45 goal votes - 40 actual votes = 5 votes. Therefore the answer is 5
User: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?
Response: Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total. For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total. Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days. However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks. They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes. And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours. So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total. They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75. They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need. Therefore the answer is 4
