User: Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the childrenâ€™s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Response: The tickets for both of her brothers will cost her $10 * 2 = $20. To buy tickets for all of them, it will cost Isabelle $20 + $20 = $40. Between all of them, they have saved a total of $5 + $5 = $10. Since they have already saved $10, she needs to earn an additional $40 - $10 = $30 to afford the tickets. Since she makes $3 per week, it will take her $30 / ($3/week) = 10 weeks to save enough money for all of the tickets. Therefore the answer is 10
User: Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. If Tyson is 20, how old is Kyle?

User: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, with both costing $20 each. If she got a 20% discount on the pencils and bought 100 cucumbers, calculate the total amount she spent to buy the items.
Response: Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils, meaning she bought 100/2 = 50 pencils. The total cost for purchasing the pencils without the discount is 50*$20 = $1000. At a 20% discount, Isabela paid 20/100*$1000 = $200 less. The total amount of money she used to buy the pencils is $1000-$200 = $800. She also bought the cucumbers at a total cost of $20*100=$2000. The total cost for the items is $2000+$800= $2800. Therefore the answer is 2800

User: In a bowl of fruit, there are 2 bananas, twice as many apples, and some oranges. In total there are 12 fruits in the bowl. How many oranges are in the bowl?

User: Tony is driving his car between his town and a friend's down. The towns are 120 miles apart and he gets there in 3 hours. The next day, he is driving to see another friend who lives 200 miles away from his friend. If he drives at the same speed, how long will the drive take?
Response: He is driving 40 MPH because 120 / 3 = 40. It will take him 5 hours because 200 / 40 = 5. Therefore the answer is 5
User: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?

User: Jenna's doctor tells her that she should tan no more than 200 minutes a month. If she tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week for the first two weeks of the month, how many minutes can she tan in the last two weeks of the month?
Response: First find how many minutes Jenna tans each of the first two weeks: 30 minutes/day * 2 days/week = 60 minutes/week. Then multiply that number by the number of weeks to find how many minutes Jenna tans in the first half of the month: 60 minutes/week * 2 weeks = 120 minutes. Then subtract that time from the total time Jenna can spend tanning to find how many more minutes she can tan: 200 minutes - 120 minutes = 80 minutes. Therefore the answer is 80
