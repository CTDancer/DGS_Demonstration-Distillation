User: Chris’s internet bill is $45 per month for 100 GB and $0.25 for every 1 GB over. His bill for this month is $65. How many GB over was Chris charged for on this bill?
Response: Let G stand for the number of GB billed, so the total bill is $0.25G + $45 flat rate charge = $65 total bill. Now we will solve for G. $0.25G + $45 flat rate - $45 = $65 -$45. This simplifies to $0.25G = $20. $0.25G/$0.25 = $20/$0.25. G = 80 GB were charged on this bill. Therefore the answer is 80
User: Dakota gets hit by a bus and has to spend 3 days in the hospital. The hospital charges her $900/day for her bed, $250/hour for two specialists to look at her 15 minutes each, and $1800 for the ambulance ride. How much is Dakota's medical bill?
Response: First find the total cost of the hospital bed by multiplying the cost per day by the number of days: $900/day * 3 days = $2700. Then figure out how many minutes total the two specialists looked at Dakota: 15 minutes/specialist * 2 specialists = 30 minutes. Then divide the number of minutes by the number of minutes per hour and multiply it by the specialists' hourly rate to find their total charge: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour * $250/hour = $125. Finally, add up the cost of the specialists, ambulance and bed to find Dakota's total bill: $2700 + $1800 + $125 = $4625. Therefore the answer is 4625

User: The size of a bathroom is 96 sq ft. If the width of the bathroom is 8 feet and the owner wants to extend it by 2 feet on each side, what is the new area of the bathroom?
Response: The original length of the bathroom is 96 sq ft/8 ft = 12 ft. The new length of the bathroom is 12ft + 2 ft = 14 ft. The new width of the bathroom is 8 ft + 2 ft = 10 ft. The new area of the bathroom is 14ft x 10 ft = 140 sq ft. Therefore the answer is 140

User: At a birthday party, 30% of the guests are married, 50% are single, and the rest are children. If there are 1000 guests, how many more married people are there than children?
Response: There are 1000 x 30/100 = 300 people who are married. There are 1000 x 50/100 = 500 people who are single. So, there are a total of 300 + 500 = 800 that are either married or single. This means, 1000 - 800 = 200 are children. Therefore, there are 300 - 200 = 100 more married people than children. Therefore the answer is 100
User: At the beginning of the day, Principal Kumar instructed Harold to raise the flag up the flagpole.  The flagpole is 60 feet long, and when fully raised, the flag sits on the very top of the flagpole.  Later that morning, Vice-principal Zizi instructed Harold to lower the flag to half-mast.  So, Harold lowered the flag halfway down the pole.   Later, Principal Kumar told Harold to raise the flag to the top of the pole once again, and Harold did just that.  At the end of the day, Vice-principal Zizi instructed Harold to completely lower the flag, take it off of the pole, and put it away for the evening.  Over the course of the day, how far, in feet, had the flag moved up and down the pole?
Response: Half of the distance up the flagpole is 60/2 = 30 feet. Thus, Harold moved the flag 60 up + 30 down + 30 up + 60 down = 180 feet. Therefore the answer is 180
