User: Passage: Right turns on red are permitted in many regions of North America. While Western states have allowed it for more than 50 years; eastern states amended their traffic laws to allow it in the 1970s as a fuel-saving measure in response to motor fuel shortages in 1973. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required in §362(c)(5) that in order for a state to receive federal assistance in developing mandated conservation programs, they must permit right turns on red lights. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have allowed right turns on red since 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where right turns are controlled by dedicated traffic lights. (On January 1, 1980, Massachusetts became the last US state to allow right turns on red.) The few exceptions include New York City, where right turns on red are prohibited, unless a sign indicates otherwise. Question: can you turn right on red in idaho?
Response: True
User: Passage: In the United States, the diploma privilege is a method for lawyers to be admitted to the bar without taking a bar examination. Once used by as many as 32 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, Wisconsin is currently the longest-running state that offers a broad diploma privilege for admission to its state bar. New Hampshire has offered diploma privilege to students that attend the state's only law school since 2005 and the state of Iowa considered reinstating diploma privilege in 2014. Originally used as a method to foster the growth of formal legal education, the privilege started to fall into disuse early in the 20th century, in common with the tightening of requirements in other learned professions. The privilege was abolished in California in 1917. Most recently, West Virginia did away with the privilege in 1988, preceded by Montana and South Dakota in 1983 and Mississippi in 1981. Question: do you have to take the bar exam in wisconsin?

User: Passage: In common usage, the mass of an object is often referred to as its weight, though these are in fact different concepts and quantities. In scientific contexts, mass refers loosely to the amount of ``matter'' in an object (though ``matter'' may be difficult to define), whereas weight refers to the force exerted on an object by gravity. In other words, an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram will weigh approximately 9.81 newtons on the surface of the Earth (its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength), since the newton is a unit of force, while the kilogram is a unit of mass. The object's weight will be less on Mars (where gravity is weaker), more on Saturn, and negligible in space when far from any significant source of gravity, but it will always have the same mass. Question: does the mass of the person make any difference?
Response: True
User: Passage: The city of Lloydminster is the only exception to this arrangement. Located partly in Saskatchewan and partly in Alberta, it observes Mountain Time year-round, and changes its clocks for DST. Since Lloydminster does change its clocks, the time in Saskatchewan is the same in all parts of the province during the summer months. Question: is there a time change between alberta and saskatchewan?
Response: True
