# Distilled User-Response Pairs

```User: Darius scored 10 points. Marius scored 3 points more than Darius, and Darius scored 5 points less than Matt. How many points did all three friends score together?
Response: If Darius scored 10 points, then Marius scored 10 + 3 = 13 points in total. Darius scored 5 points less than Matt, so Matt scored 10 + 5 = 15 points in total. So all three friends gathered 13 + 15 + 10 = 38 points. Therefore the answer is 38

User: A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. 3/5 of its capacity entered the bus at the first pickup. If 50 people were at the next pick-up, how many could not take the bus because it was full?
Response: At the first pick-up point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity, a total of 3/5*80 = 48. The available seats in the bus after the first pick up point is 80-48 = 32. If there were 50 people in the second pick-up station, and only 32 sits were available, the number of people who did not take the bus because it was full is 50-32=18. Therefore the answer is 18

User: James burns 300 calories an hour walking. He dances and loses twice as many calories per hour. He dances twice a day for .5 hours each, 4 times a week. How many calories does he lose a week from dancing?
Response: He burns 2*300=600 calories an hour. He dances for .5*2=1 hour per day. So he burns 600*1=600 calories per day. So he burns 600*4=2400 calories per week. Therefore the answer is 2400

User: Happy Cattle Ranch has 200 cows. Every year, the number of cows increases by half of the current number. How many cows will be there in two years?
Response: In one year, the rancher will have 200 + 200/2 = 200 + 100 = 300 cows. In two years, the rancher will have 300 + 300/2 = 300 + 150 = 450 cows. Therefore the answer is 450

User: Lilia has 15 peaches. She sold 10 peaches for $2 each and 4 peaches for $1.25 each. How much did she earn after selling 14 peaches?
Response: Lilia earned 10 x $2 = $20 for selling the peaches to her friends. She also earned 4 x $1.25 = $5 for selling the peaches to her relatives. Therefore, Lilia earned $20 + $5 = $25 for selling 14 peaches. Therefore the answer is 25

User: Out of 150 students, 60% are girls and the rest are boys. 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs. How many boys did not join?
Response: Out of the 150 students, 100% - 60% = 40% are boys. So, there are 150 x 40/100 = 60 boys. Out of the 60 boys, 60 x 1/3 = 20 joined varsity clubs. Therefore, 60 - 20 = 40 boys did not join varsity clubs. Therefore the answer is 40

User: Samanta has 8 more points than Mark. Mark has 50% more points than Eric, who has 6 points. How many points do all three have in total?
Response: Mark has 50/100 * 6 = 3 points more than Eric. So Mark has 6 + 3 = 9 points. That means Samanta has 9 + 8 = 17 points. So in total they have 6 + 9 + 17 = 32 points. Therefore the answer is 32

User: A sugar bag weighs 16 kg and a salt bag weighs 30 kg. If you remove 4 kg from their combined weight, how much do they weigh now?

```User: Darius, Matt, and Marius are friends, who played table football. During all the games they played, Marius scored 3 points more than Darius, and Darius scored 5 points less than Matt. How many points did all three friends score together, if Darius scored 10 points?
Response: Marius scored 10 + 3 = 13 points because Marius scored 3 points more than Darius. Darius scored 10 points because it's given. Matt scored 10 + 5 = 15 points because Darius scored 5 points less than Matt. So, all three friends scored 13 + 15 + 10 = 38 points in total.

User: A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity. If there were 50 people at the next pick-up point, how many people could not take the bus because it was full?
Response: At the first pick-up point, 3/5 * 80 = 48 people entered the bus because it's 3/5 of its capacity. After the first pickup, there were 80 - 48 = 32 seats available. Since there were 50 people at the next pickup, 50 - 32 = 18 people could not take the bus because it was full.

User: James takes up dancing for fitness. He loses twice as many calories per hour as he did when he was walking. He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time and he does this 4 times a week. He burned 300 calories an hour walking. How many calories does he lose a week from dancing?
Response: James burns 2 * 300 = 600 calories per hour because he loses twice as many calories as when he was walking. He dances for 0.5 hours twice a day, so he burns 600 * 0.5 = 300 calories per day. Over 4 days, he burns 300 * 4 = 1200 calories per week.

User: Happy Cattle Ranch is home to 200 cows. Every year, the mother cows have enough calves that the number of cows the rancher owns rises by half the number of cows living on the ranch. If the rancher does not buy or sell any cows, how many cows will the rancher own on Happy Cattle Ranch in two years?
Response: In one year, the number of cows increases by half of 200, which is 200 * 0.5 = 100 cows. So, after one year, there will be 200 + 100 = 300 cows on the ranch. In two years, the number increases by half of 300, which is 300 * 0.5 = 150 cows. So, in two years, the rancher will own 300 + 150 = 450 cows.

User: Lilia has 15 peaches. She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each, while 4 other peaches were sold to her relatives for $1.25 each, and she left the other one for herself. How much did she earn after selling 14 peaches?
Response: Lilia earned $20 for selling 10 peaches to her friends because 10 * $2 = $20. She also earned $5 for selling 4 peaches to her relatives because 4 * $1.25 = $5. Therefore, Lilia earned $20 + $5 = $25 for selling 14 peaches.

User: Out of the 150 students, 60% are girls and the rest are boys. Only 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs. How many of the boys did not join varsity clubs?
Response: Among the 150 students, 60% are girls, so the rest, which is 100% - 60% = 40%, are boys. There are 40% of 150 students, which is 0.4 * 150 = 60 boys. Out of these boys, 1/3 joined varsity clubs, which is (1/3) * 60 = 20 boys. So, the number of boys who did not join varsity clubs is 60 - 20 = 40 boys.

User: In a game, Samanta has 8 more points than Mark, and Mark has 50% more points than Eric. Eric has 6 points. How many points do Samanta, Mark, and Eric have in total?

User: Darius, Matt, and Marius are friends, who played table football. During all the games they played, Marius scored 3 points more than Darius, and Darius scored 5 points less than Matt. How many points did all three friends score together, if Darius scored 10 points?
Response: If Darius scored 10 points, then Marius scored 10 + 3 = 13 points in total. Darius scored 5 points less than Matt, so Matt scored 10 + 5 = 15 points in total. So all three friends gathered 13 + 15 + 10 = 38 points. Therefore the answer is 38
User: A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity. If there were 50 people at the next pick-up point, how many people could not take the bus because it was full?
Response: At the first pick-up point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity, a total of 3/5*80 = 48. The available seats in the bus after the first pick up point is 80-48 = 32. If there were 50 people in the second pick-up station, and only 32 sits were available, the number of people who did not take the bus because it was full is 50-32=18. Therefore the answer is 18

```User: Darius, Matt, and Marius are friends, who played table football. During all the games they played, Marius scored 3 points more than Darius, and Darius scored 5 points less than Matt. How many points did all three friends score together, if Darius scored 10 points?
Response: If Darius scored 10 points, then Marius scored 10 + 3 = 13 points in total. Darius scored 5 points less than Matt, so Matt scored 10 + 5 = 15 points in total. So all three friends gathered 13 + 15 + 10 = 38 points. Therefore the answer is 38.

User: A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity. If there were 50 people at the next pick-up point, how many people could not take the bus because it was full?
Response: At the first pick-up point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity, a total of 3/5 * 80 = 48. The available seats in the bus after the first pick-up point are 80 - 48 = 32. If there were 50 people in the second pick-up station, and only 32 seats were available, the number of people who did not take the bus because it was full is 50 - 32 = 18. Therefore the answer is 18.

User: James takes up dancing for fitness. He loses twice as many calories per hour as he did when he was walking. He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time, 4 times a week. He burned 300 calories an hour walking. How many calories does he lose a week from dancing?
Response: He burns 2 * 300 = 600 calories an hour. He dances for 0.5 * 2 = 1 hour per day. So he burns 600 * 1 = 600 calories per day. So he burns 600 * 4 = 2400 calories per week. Therefore the answer is 2400.

User: Happy Cattle Ranch is home to 200 cows. Every year, the mother cows have enough calves that the number of cows the rancher owns rises by half the number of cows living on the ranch. If the rancher does not buy or sell any cows, how many cows will the rancher own on Happy Cattle Ranch in two years?
Response: In one year, the rancher will have 200 + 200/2 = 300 cows. In two years, the rancher will have 300 + 300/2 = 450 cows. Therefore the answer is 450.

User: Lilia has 15 peaches. She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each, while 4 other peaches were sold to her relatives for $1.25 each, and she left the other one for herself. How much did she earn after selling 14 peaches?
Response: Lilia earned $20 for selling the peaches to her friends (10 x $2) and $5 for selling the peaches to her relatives (4 x $1.25). Therefore, Lilia earned $20 + $5 = $25 for selling 14 peaches. Therefore the answer is 25.

User: Out of the 150 students, 60% are girls and the rest are boys. Only 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs. How many of the boys did not join varsity clubs?
Response: Out of the 150 students, 100% - 60% = 40% are boys. So, there are 150 x 40/100 = 60 boys. Out of the 60 boys, 60 x 1/3 = 20 joined varsity clubs. Therefore, 60 - 20 = 40 boys did not join varsity clubs. Therefore the answer is 40.

User: In a game, Samanta has 8 more points than Mark, and Mark has 50% more points than Eric. Eric has 6 points. How many points do Samanta, Mark, and Eric have in total?
Response: Mark has 50/100 * 6 = 3 points more than Eric. So Mark has 6 + 3 = 9 points. That means Samanta has 9 + 8 = 17 points. So in total, Samanta, Mark, and Eric have 6 + 9 + 17 = 32 points. Therefore the answer is 32.

User: A bag full of sugar weighs 16 kg. A bag full of salt weighs 30 kg. If you remove 4 kg from the combined weight of these two bags, how much do the bags now weigh?
Response: The bags together weigh 16 + 30 = 46 kg. Removing 4 kg, the bags will weigh 46 - 4 = 42 kg.```

Response: At the first pick-up point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity, a total of 3/5*80 = 48. The available seats in the bus after the first pick up point is 80-48 = 32. If there were 50 people in the second pick-up station, and only 32 sits were available, the number of people who did not take the bus because it was full is 50-32=18. Therefore the answer is 18

Response: In one year, the rancher will have 200 + 200/2 = 200 + 100 = 300 cows. In two years, the rancher will have 300 + 300/2 = 300 + 150 = 450 cows. Therefore the answer is 450
User: Lilia has 15 peaches. She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each, while 4 other peaches were sold to her relatives for $1.25 each, and she left the other one for herself. How much did she earn after selling 14 peaches?
Response: Lilia earned 10 x $2 = $20 for selling the peaches to her friends. She also earned 4 x $1.25 = $5 for selling the peaches to her relatives. Therefore, Lilia earned $20 + $5 = $25 for selling 14 peaches. Therefore the answer is 25
User: Out of the 150 students, 60% are girls and the rest are boys. Only 1/3 of the boys joined varsity clubs. How many of the boys did not join varsity clubs?
Response: Out of the 150 students, 100% - 60% = 40% are boys. So, there are 150 x 40/100 = 60 boys. Out of the 60 boys, 60 x 1/3 = 20 joined varsity clubs. Therefore, 60 - 20 = 40 boys did not join varsity clubs. Therefore the answer is 40
User: In a game, Samanta has 8 more points than Mark, and Mark has 50% more points than Eric. Eric has 6 points. How many points do Samanta, Mark, and Eric have in total?

User: A bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was 3/5 of its carrying capacity. If there were 50 people at the next pick-up point, how many people could not take the bus because it was full?
Response: At the first pickup point, 48 people entered the bus (3/5 of 80). Therefore, 80 - 48 = 32 people could not take the bus because it was full when 50 people arrived.

User: James takes up dancing for fitness. He loses twice as many calories per hour as he did when he was walking. He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time and he does this 4 times a week. He burned 300 calories an hour walking. How many calories does he lose a week from dancing?
Response: James burns 600 calories per hour while dancing (twice as much as walking). He dances for a total of 4 hours per week (2 times a day for 0.5 hours each, 4 times a week). So, he burns 600 * 4 = 2400 calories per week from dancing.
