User: Among the career home run leaders for MLB, Hank Aaron has 175 fewer than twice the number that Dave Winfield has. Hank Aaron hit 755 home runs. How many home runs did Dave Winfield hit in his career?
Response: Let x be the number of home runs Dave Winfield hit. Hank Aaron hit 2x - 175 home runs. Given Hank Aaron hit 755, we have the equation 2x - 175 = 755. Solving for x, we get x = 465. Dave Winfield hit 465 home runs. Answer: 465

User: Marcus is making calzones. It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?
Response: Sauteing garlic and peppers takes 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Kneading and resting the dough takes 30 + 2*30 = 90 minutes. Assembling takes 1/10 * 90 = 9 minutes. In total, Marcus spends 5 + 90 + 9 = 104 minutes on the calzones. Answer: 104

User: Marcus is making calzones. It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?
Response: First find the amount of time it takes Marcus to saute the garlic and peppers: 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes. Then find the dough's resting time: 30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes. Then add the kneading and resting time to find the total dough time: 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes. Then multiply that amount by 1/10th to find the assembly time: 90 minutes / 10 = 9 minutes. Then add the saute time, knead time, rest time and assembly time to find the total time Marcus spends on the calzones: 9 minutes + 20 minutes + 5 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 124 minutes. Therefore the answer is 124
User: James decides to buy himself a new barbell.  It cost 30% more than his old $250 barbell.  How much did it cost?

Response: Jessica's pumpkin weighs half the weight of Brad's 54-pound pumpkin so 54/2 = 27 pounds. Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the amount of Jessica's 27-pound pumpkin so it weighs 4*27 = 108. Betty has the heaviest pumpkin at 108 pounds while Jessica's is the lowest at 27 pounds so the difference is 108-27 =81 pounds. Therefore the answer is 81
User: John's new computer cost $1500.  He needs to get a monitor and other peripherals that cost 1/5 that much.  He also wants to upgrade the $300 video card in the base computer with one that costs twice as much.  How much did he spend?
Response: The peripherals cost 1500/5=$300. The video card cost 300*2=$600. So it cost 600-300=$300 more. That means the total cost was 1500+300+300=$2100. Therefore the answer is 2100
User: Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute.  Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her.  After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?
Response: Robert coughs twice as much as Georgia who coughs 5 times so Robert coughs 2*5 = 10 coughs per minute. Georgia coughs 5 times and Robert coughs 10 times so together they cough 5+10 = 15 times per minute. After 20 minutes they will have coughed 15*20 = 300 coughs. Therefore the answer is 300
User: Justice has 3 ferns, 5 palms, and 7 succulent plants in her house. If she wants a total of 24 plants in her home, how many more plants does she need?

User: There were 25 peaches in each basket. Five baskets of peaches were delivered to a market. The farmers have eaten 5 peaches. The remaining peaches are packed into smaller boxes of 15 each. How many boxes of peaches are there?
Response: The total number of peaches delivered to a market was 5 x 25 = 125. The remaining peaches after 5 were eaten was 150 - 5 = 145. So, there are 120/15 = 8 smaller boxes of peaches. Therefore the answer is 8
User: Among the career home run leaders for MLB, Hank Aaron has 175 fewer than twice the number that Dave Winfield has.  Hank Aaron hit 755 home runs.  How many home runs did Dave Winfield hit in his career?
Response: Let x be the number of home runs Dave Winfield hit. 755=2x-175. 930=2x. x=465 home runs. Therefore the answer is 465
User: Marcus is making calzones. It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?
Response: First find the amount of time it takes Marcus to saute the garlic and peppers: 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes. Then find the dough's resting time: 30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes. Then add the kneading and resting time to find the total dough time: 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes. Then multiply that amount by 1/10th to find the assembly time: 90 minutes / 10 = 9 minutes. Then add the saute time, knead time, rest time and assembly time to find the total time Marcus spends on the calzones: 9 minutes + 20 minutes + 5 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 124 minutes. Therefore the answer is 124
User: James decides to buy himself a new barbell.  It cost 30% more than his old $250 barbell.  How much did it cost?
Response: It cost 250*.3=$75 more than his old barbell. So it cost 250+75=$325. Therefore the answer is 325
User: The county fair was hosting a pumpkin contest to see who could grow the biggest pumpkin in pounds.  Brad entered his pumpkin with a weight of 54 pounds.  Jessica's was half the weight of Brad's.  Betty's pumpkin weight 4 times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin.  What is the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin in  pounds?
Response: Jessica's pumpkin weighs half the weight of Brad's 54-pound pumpkin so 54/2 = 27 pounds. Betty's pumpkin weighs 4 times the amount of Jessica's 27-pound pumpkin so it weighs 4*27 = 108. Betty has the heaviest pumpkin at 108 pounds while Jessica's is the lowest at 27 pounds so the difference is 108-27 =81 pounds. Therefore the answer is 81
User: John's new computer cost $1500.  He needs to get a monitor and other peripherals that cost 1/5 that much.  He also wants to upgrade the $300 video card in the base computer with one that costs twice as much.  How much did he spend?
Response: The peripherals cost 1500/5=$300. The video card cost 300*2=$600. So it cost 600-300=$300 more. That means the total cost was 1500+300+300=$2100. Therefore the answer is 2100
User: Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute.  Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her.  After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?
Response: Robert coughs twice as much as Georgia who coughs 5 times so Robert coughs 2*5 = 10 coughs per minute. Georgia coughs 5 times and Robert coughs 10 times so together they cough 5+10 = 15 times per minute. After 20 minutes they will have coughed 15*20 = 300 coughs. Therefore the answer is 300
User: Justice has 3 ferns, 5 palms, and 7 succulent plants in her house. If she wants a total of 24 plants in her home, how many more plants does she need?
Response: Justice currently has 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 plants in her house. Justice needs 24 - 15 = 9 more plants. Therefore the answer is 9

User: Marcus is making calzones. It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?
Response: First find the amount of time it takes Marcus to saute the garlic and peppers: 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes. Then find the dough's resting time: 30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes. Then add the kneading and resting time to find the total dough time: 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes. Then multiply that amount by 1/10th to find the assembly time: 90 minutes / 10 = 9 minutes. Then add the saute time, knead time, rest time and assembly time to find the total time Marcus spends on the calzones: 9 minutes + 20 minutes + 5 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 124 minutes. Therefore the answer is 124

User: Marcus is making calzones. It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?
Response: First find the amount of time it takes Marcus to saute the garlic and peppers: 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes. Then find the dough's resting time: 30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes. Then add the kneading and resting time to find the total dough time: 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes. Then multiply that amount by 1/10th to find the assembly time: 90 minutes / 10 = 9 minutes. Then add the saute time, knead time, rest time and assembly time to find the total time Marcus spends on the calzones: 9 minutes + 20 minutes + 5 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 124 minutes. Therefore the answer is 124
