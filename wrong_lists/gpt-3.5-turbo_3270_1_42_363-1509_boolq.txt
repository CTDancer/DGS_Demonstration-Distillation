        "question": "Passage: While the Laws of the Game continue to provide for competitive scrums, a convention exists that some scrum rules are not enforced. During the 1970s, scrum penalties for feeding the ball into the legs of the second row, packs moving off the ``mark'' or collapsing the scrum were seen as unattractive. The ability of teams to win a game purely on goals from scrum penalties was also seen as unfair. In an effort to improve this situation, changes to rules and their enforcement were made. The number of scrums was reduced with the introduction of the ``handover'' after a team has used a set of six tackles, the differential penalty, one which cannot be kicked at goal was brought in for offences at scrums and referees ceased enforcing some rules regarding feeding the ball into scrum. Aided by this change, it is common for professional teams not to fully contest scrums, according to their choice of tactics. Question: can you contest a scrum in rugby league?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nIn rugby league, the ability to contest scrums has been significantly reduced over the years, and it is common for professional teams not to fully contest scrums, as mentioned in the passage. This change was implemented to make the game more attractive and reduce the influence of scrum penalties on the outcome of the game. Scrums in rugby league have evolved to the point where they are now often more about restarting play than competitive pushing and shoving.",

        "pred_ans": "False\nExplanation: In the given passage, it is stated that \"Every rhombus is a parallelogram and a kite.\" This statement implies that a rhombus has two pairs of parallel sides, as both parallelograms and kites have this property. So, the statement suggests that rhombuses have 2 pairs of parallel sides. However, this is not always the case.\n\nA rhombus is a type of parallelogram where all sides are of equal length. While it does have two pairs of opposite sides that are parallel, it does not necessarily have the additional property of having all angles equal to 90 degrees, which is characteristic of a square. So, some rhombuses may not have right angles, and they would still be rhombuses with two pairs of parallel sides. Therefore, the statement \"do all rhombuses have 2 pairs of parallel sides\" is False, as not all rhombuses have right angles.",

        "question": "Passage: All biomass goes through at least some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented, distilled, and burned. All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance (or ``energy returned on energy invested''). Figures compiled in a 2007 report by National Geographic Magazine point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical climate to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended, as compared to corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended. A 2006 University of California Berkeley study, after analyzing six separate studies, concluded that producing ethanol from corn uses much less petroleum than producing gasoline. Question: does ethanol take more energy make that produces?",
        "pred_ans": "The question of whether ethanol production consumes more energy than it produces is not a straightforward one, as it depends on various factors, including the source of the ethanol (e.g., corn or sugarcane) and the specific methods used in its production. \n\nThe passage provides information about the energy balance for ethanol production. In the case of corn ethanol produced in the US, it mentions that one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. This implies that the energy input is slightly higher than the energy output for corn ethanol in the US, indicating a relatively less favorable energy balance.\n\nHowever, it also mentions that the energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 energy units from the ethanol. This suggests that sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil is more efficient in terms of energy balance.\n\nAdditionally, the passage notes that there are contradictory reports and that the energy balance estimates can vary. For example, some reports suggest that ethanol production from sugarcane in tropical climates can yield a much more favorable energy balance compared to corn ethanol.\n\nGiven these variations and contradictions in the available data, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer to whether ethanol takes more energy to make than it produces based solely on the information provided in the passage. The energy balance for ethanol production can vary significantly depending on factors such as feedstock, location, and production methods. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"Not clear\" or \"Uncertain\" because it requires a more detailed analysis of specific cases and additional data to draw a firm conclusion.",

        "question": "Passage: As all executive authority is vested in the sovereign, their assent is required to allow for bills to become law and for letters patent and orders in council to have legal effect. While the power for these acts stems from the Canadian people through the constitutional conventions of democracy, executive authority remains vested in the Crown and is only entrusted by the sovereign to their government on behalf of the people, underlining the Crown's role in safeguarding the rights, freedoms, and democratic system of government of Canadians, and reinforcing the fact that ``governments are the servants of the people and not the reverse''. Thus, within a constitutional monarchy the sovereign's direct participation in any of these areas of governance is limited, with the sovereign normally exercising executive authority only on the advice of the executive committee of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, with the sovereign's legislative and judicial responsibilities largely carried out through parliamentarians as well as judges and justices of the peace. The Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard against abuse of power, the sovereign acting as a custodian of the Crown's democratic powers and a representation of the ``power of the people above government and political parties''.

The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet.

The arrangement transpired after a bargain for his blood that would cure Damon of the werewolf bite he had received from Tyler. At first, he is reluctant to involve Elena in the rescue attempts, employing Alaric Saltzman, Elena's guardian, instead as Klaus does not know that Elena is alive after the sacrifice which frees Klaus' hybrid side. However, Elena involves herself, desperate to find Stefan. Damon, though hesitant at first, is unable to refuse her because of his love for her. He also points out to her that she once turned back from finding Stefan since she knew Damon would be in danger, clearly showing that she also has feelings for him. He tells her that ``when (he) drag(s) (his) brother from the edge to deliver him back to (her), (he) wants her to remember the things (she) felt while he was gone.'' When Stefan finally returns to Mystic Falls, his attitude is different from that of the first and second seasons. This causes a rift between Elena and Stefan whereas the relationship between Damon and Elena becomes closer and more intimate. A still loyal Elena, however, refuses to admit her feelings for Damon. In 'Dangerous Liaisons', Elena, frustrated with her feelings for him, tells Damon that his love for her may be a problem, and that this could be causing all their troubles. This incenses Damon, causing him to revert to the uncaring and reckless Damon seen in the previous seasons. The rocky relationship between the two continues until the sexual tension hits the fan and in a moment of heated passion, Elena -- for the first time in the three seasons -- kisses Damon of her own accord. This kiss finally causes Elena to admit that she loves both brothers and realize that she must ultimately make her choice as her own ancestress, Katherine Pierce, who turned the brothers, once did. In assessment of her feelings for Damon, she states this: ``Damon just sort of snuck up on me. He got under my skin and no matter what I do, I can't shake him.'' In the season finale, a trip designed to get her to safety forces Elena to make her choice: to go to Damon and possibly see him one last time; or to go to Stefan and her friends and see them one last time. She chooses the latter when she calls Damon to tell him her decision. Damon, who is trying to stop Alaric, accepts what she says and she tells him that maybe if she had met Damon before she had met Stefan, her choice may have been different. This statement causes Damon to remember the first night he did meet Elena which was, in fact, the night her parents died - before she had met Stefan. Not wanting anyone to know he was in town and after giving her some advice about life and love, Damon compels her to forget. He remembers this as he fights Alaric and seems accepting of his death when Alaric, whose life line is tied to Elena's, suddenly collapses in his arms.

This device must be interference fit to the crankshaft in order to operate in an effective manner. An interference fit ensures the device moves in perfect step with crankshaft. It is essential on engines with long crankshafts (such as straight-8 engines) and V8 engines with cross plane cranks. Harmonics and torsional vibrations can greatly reduce crankshaft life, or cause instantaneous failure if the crankshaft runs at or through an amplified resonance. Dampers are designed with a specific weight (mass) which is dependent on the damping material/method used and the freedom it affords the mass move allowing to reduce mechanical Q factor, or damp, crankshaft resonances. A harmonic balancer (sometimes crankshaft damper, torsional damper, or vibration damper) is the same thing as a harmonic damper except that the balancer includes a counterweight to externally balance the rotating assembly.

Additionally, it often serves as a pulley for the accessory drive belts, which turn various components like the alternator, water pump, and other crankshaft-driven devices. So, it has a dual function as both a vibration damper and an accessory drive pulley.\n\nOn the other hand, a **crankshaft pulley** is a pulley wheel mounted on the crankshaft, and its main function is to drive the engine's accessories by means of belts. It does not include the vibration-dampening features found in a harmonic balancer.\n\nIn summary, while a harmonic balancer includes a crankshaft pulley as part of its design, they are not the same thing. The harmonic balancer has additional functions related to dampening vibrations in the crankshaft, whereas the crankshaft pulley primarily serves as a means to drive accessory components.",

A spark plug has a metal threaded shell, electrically isolated from a central electrode by a porcelain insulator. The central electrode, which may contain a resistor, is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an ignition coil or magneto. The spark plug's metal shell is screwed into the engine's cylinder head and thus electrically grounded. The central electrode protrudes through the porcelain insulator into the combustion chamber, forming one or more spark gaps between the inner end of the central electrode and usually one or more protuberances or structures attached to the inner end of the threaded shell and designated the side, earth, or ground electrode(s).

        "question": "Passage: In no-limit and pot-limit games, there is a minimum amount that is required to be bet in order to open the action. In games with blinds, this amount is usually the amount of the big blind. Standard poker rules require that raises must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise. For example, if an opponent bets $5, a player must raise by at least another $5, and they may not raise by only $2. If a player raises a bet of $5 by $7 (for a total of $12), the next re-raise would have to be by at least another $7 (the previous raise) more than the $12 (for a total of at least $19). The primary purpose of the minimum raise rule is to avoid game delays caused by ``nuisance'' raises (small raises of large bets, such as an extra $1 over a current bet of $50, that have little effect on the action but take time as all others must call). This rule is overridden by table stakes rules, so that a player may in fact raise a $5 bet by $2 if that $2 is his entire remaining stake. Question: do you have to raise double in poker?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nIn poker, you do not have to raise double the previous bet as a general rule. Standard poker rules require that raises must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise. So, if an opponent bets $5, a player must raise by at least another $5, but they do not need to double the previous bet. \n\nHowever, there are some specific poker variants and house rules where a double raise might be required, but these are exceptions to the standard rules. In most commonly played poker games, a minimum raise that matches the previous bet or raise is sufficient to continue the action. The primary purpose of this rule is to prevent \"nuisance\" raises, which are small raises of large bets that can slow down the game without significantly affecting the outcome. \n\nIt's important to note that table stakes rules can also come into play, allowing a player to raise with the entirety of their remaining stake, which might be less than double the previous bet.

They tend to be time-related, such as salaries or rents being paid per month, and are often referred to as overhead costs. This is in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related (and are paid per quantity produced). For a simple example, such as a bakery, the monthly rent for the baking facilities, and the monthly payments for the security system and basic phone line are fixed costs, as they do not change according to how much bread the bakery produces and sells. On the other hands, the wage costs of the bakery are variable, as the bakery will have to hire more workers if the production of bread increases. The relation between fixed cost and variable cost can be modelled by an analytical formula. Question: are fixed costs and overhead costs the same?",

It can apply to both plants and animals. Artificial selection doesn't necessarily imply human intervention in every aspect of the breeding process; it simply means that humans are guiding the selection based on desired characteristics.\n\n2. **Selective Breeding:** Selective breeding is a specific type of artificial selection. It refers to the deliberate breeding of organisms, either plants or animals, with the intent to develop and propagate particular desirable traits or characteristics. Selective breeding often involves careful pairing of individuals with known traits to create offspring that exhibit those traits more consistently.\n\nIn summary, while artificial selection is a more general term that includes various forms of human-guided selection in breeding, selective breeding specifically refers to the intentional breeding of organisms for the purpose of enhancing particular traits.",

In the town of Chapel Hill, open carry is restricted to guns of a certain minimum size, under the theory that small, concealable handguns are more often associated with criminal activity. No permit is required to carry a handgun openly in North Carolina. In the court case of State v. Kerner(1921) the defendant ended up getting into some type of confrontation with another man. The defendant proceeded to walk back to his place of work, get his gun, and then return to the scene to fight. The defendant ended up being charged with ``carrying a concealed weapon'' and ``carrying his pistol off his premises unconcealed,'' which violated a local act applicable to Forsyth County and ended up being a misdemeanor. The defendant was taken to trial and the trial judge then dismissed the charge as unconstitutional. The state then appealed, and the supreme court affirmed. During court, the court stated at the beginning that the Second Amendment did not apply, because ``the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are restrictions on the federal authority and not the states.'' Therefore, with that being said, it focused more on the state constitution. The state constitution states that: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The court viewed the provision as protecting the right to carry arms in public. Forsyth County's local act was condemned and seen as distasteful, because it ended up putting a restriction on a persons right to carry a pistol, more so an unconcealed pistol. Although, the case of State v. Kerner helped/made more clear the allowance of openly carrying a pistol, it does not preclude all regulations regarding the carrying of firearms.

Back-passes with parts of the body other than the foot, such as headers, are not prohibited. Despite the popular name ``back-pass rule'', there is no requirement in the laws that the kick or throw-in must be backwards; handling by the goalkeeper is forbidden regardless of the direction the ball travels. Question: can a soccer goalie pick up a throw in?",

However, there is a rule known as the \"back-pass rule\" that prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball after it has been deliberately kicked to them by a teammate or after receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a teammate. This rule is in place to prevent time-wasting tactics and to encourage open play.\n\nIt's important to note that the direction of the kick or throw-in is not specified in the rule. So, whether the ball is kicked or thrown forward, backward, or sideways, if it's deliberately directed to the goalkeeper by a teammate's action, the goalkeeper cannot pick it up. However, if the ball is played to the goalkeeper with parts of the body other than the foot, such as headers, it is not prohibited, and the goalkeeper can handle it.\n\nSo, in summary, goalkeepers are generally allowed to handle a throw-in, but not if it's deliberately directed to them by a teammate, regardless of the direction of the throw-in.

The modern St. Bernard breed is radically different than the original dogs kept at the St. Bernard hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined and improved using many different large Molosser breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Ovcharka. Other breeds such as the Rottweiler, Boxer, and English Bulldog may have contributed to the St. Bernard's bloodline as well. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as seen today.

In large bilaterians, the gastrointestinal tract generally also has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of feces (solid wastes). Some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means (for example, through the mouth). The human gastrointestinal tract consists of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. The GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus, forming a continuous passageway that includes the main organs of digestion, namely, the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. However, the complete human digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver and gallbladder). The tract may also be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological origin of each segment. The whole human GI tract is about nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy. It is considerably shorter in the living body because the intestines, which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone in a halfway-tense state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention and peristalsis.

Many scholars hold that the Confederate secession was blatantly illegal. The Articles of Confederation explicitly state the Union is ``perpetual''; the U.S. Constitution declares itself an even ``more perfect union'' than the Articles of Confederation. Other scholars, while not necessarily disagreeing that the secession was illegal, point out that sovereignty is often de facto an ``extralegal'' question. Had the Confederacy won, any illegality of its actions under U.S. law would have been rendered irrelevant, just as the undisputed illegality of American rebellion under the British law of 1775 was rendered irrelevant.

In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is converted into glucose with the help of ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent reactions, ultimately providing the energy and reducing power needed for glucose synthesis.\n\nSo, while the Calvin cycle is a key component of the light-independent reactions (dark reactions), they are not synonymous.

This is a key difference between the two sports, as the pushing and contesting for possession in the scrum, which is a characteristic of rugby union, is not a part of rugby league scrums.",

Due to strains placed on active duty units following the attacks, the possible mobilization time was increased to 18 months (with no more than one year overseas). Additional strains placed on military units as a result of the invasion of Iraq further increased the amount of time a Guardsman could be mobilized to 24 months.

It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is used to identify devices on a local network. MAC addresses are typically assigned by the manufacturer and are hard-coded into the network hardware. They are used for local network communication and play a crucial role in Ethernet-based networks.\n\nOn the other hand, a physical address, in the context mentioned in the passage, is a term that can refer to various things, including the memory physical address, which is used in computer systems to locate data in physical memory. It has no direct relationship with MAC addresses or network communication.\n\nSo, in summary, a physical address and a MAC address are not the same, and they serve different purposes in different contexts.",

        "question": "Passage: Mal de debarquement (or mal de d\u00e9barquement) syndrome (MdDS, or common name disembarkment syndrome) is a neurological condition usually occurring after a cruise, aircraft flight, or other sustained motion event. The phrase ``mal de d\u00e9barquement'' is French and translates to ``illness of disembarkation''. MdDS is typically diagnosed by a neurologist or an ear nose & throat specialist when a person reports a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling (though they are not necessarily rocking). This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience. Because most vestibular testing proves to be negative, doctors may be baffled as they attempt to diagnose the syndrome. A major diagnostic indicator is that most patients feel better while driving or riding in a car, i.e.: while in passive motion. MdDS is unexplained by structural brain or inner ear pathology and most often corresponds with a motion trigger, although it can occur spontaneously. This differs from the very common condition of ``land sickness'' that most people feel for a short time after a motion event such as a boat cruise, aircraft ride, or even a treadmill routine which may only last minutes to a few hours. The syndrome has recently received increased attention due to the number of people presenting with the condition and more scientific research has commenced to determine what triggers MdDS and how to cure it. Question: is it normal to have motion sickness after a cruise?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nIt is not normal to have motion sickness after a cruise. Motion sickness, often referred to as \"seasickness\" when it occurs on a cruise, is a common condition that can affect some individuals when they are exposed to motion, such as the rocking of a boat. However, motion sickness is usually a temporary and short-lived condition that occurs during the motion event itself and typically resolves once the motion stops.\n\nThe passage describes a different condition called Mal de D\u00e9barquement Syndrome (MdDS), which is distinct from ordinary motion sickness. MdDS is characterized by persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing sensations that occur after a sustained motion event, such as a cruise or flight. It is not considered a normal response to motion, and it is a neurological condition that can be diagnosed by specialists. MdDS is different from typical motion sickness in both its duration and symptoms.\n\nSo, to clarify, it is not normal to have motion sickness persisting after a cruise; if someone experiences persistent symptoms like those described in the passage, it may indicate a condition like MdDS, which is not considered a typical response to motion.",

Neutrality of money is an important idea in classical economics and is related to the classical dichotomy. It implies that the central bank does not affect the real economy (e.g., the number of jobs, the size of real GDP, the amount of real investment) by creating money. Instead, any increase in the supply of money would be offset by a proportional rise in prices and wages. This assumption underlies some mainstream macroeconomic models (e.g., real business cycle models). Others like monetarism view money as being neutral only in the long-run. Question: does monetary neutrality mean that changes in the money supply can never affect real\u200b gdp?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nMonetary neutrality, as described in the passage, suggests that changes in the money supply primarily impact nominal variables (such as prices, wages, and exchange rates) rather than real variables (like employment, real GDP, and real consumption) in the short run. In other words, it implies that, in the short term, an increase in the money supply may lead to inflation (higher prices and wages) but may not necessarily affect real economic output or employment.\n\nHowever, the passage also mentions that some economic models, like real business cycle models, assume full monetary neutrality, meaning that changes in the money supply have no effect on real variables even in the long run. Monetarism, on the other hand, suggests that money is neutral in the long run but not necessarily in the short run.\n\nSo, while monetary neutrality implies a limited impact on real GDP in the short run, it does not necessarily mean that changes in the money supply can never affect real GDP.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are found on skeletal muscle, but also within the route of transmission for the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system (which together comprise the autonomic nervous system). More specifically, nicotinic receptors are found within the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system, allowing outgoing signals to be transmitted from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cells. Thus, for example, blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors blocks both sympathetic (excitatory) and parasympathetic (calming) stimulation of the heart. The nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium, for example, does this by blocking the transmission of outgoing signals across the autonomic ganglia at the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Question: can nicotine be classified as a ganglion blocker?",

        "question": "Passage: A perfect game is defined by Major League Baseball as a game in which a pitcher (or combination of pitchers) pitches a victory that lasts a minimum of nine innings in which no opposing player reaches base. Thus, the pitcher (or pitchers) cannot allow any hits, walks, hit batsmen, or any opposing player to reach base safely for any other reason and the fielders cannot make an error that allows an opposing player to reach a base; in short, ``27 up, 27 down.'' The feat has been achieved 23 times in MLB history -- 21 times since the modern era began in 1900, most recently by F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez of the Seattle Mariners on August 15, 2012. A perfect game is also a no-hitter and a shutout. A fielding error that does not allow a batter to reach base, such as a misplayed foul ball, does not spoil a perfect game. Weather-shortened contests in which a team has no baserunners and games in which a team reaches first base only in extra innings do not qualify as perfect games under the present definition. Question: can there be an error in a perfect game?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nIn a perfect game in Major League Baseball (MLB), no errors are allowed. A perfect game is defined as a game in which a pitcher (or combination of pitchers) pitches a victory that lasts a minimum of nine innings, and during that time, no opposing player reaches base. This means no hits, walks, hit batsmen, or any opposing player reaching base safely for any other reason. Additionally, the fielders cannot make an error that allows an opposing player to reach base. \n\nSo, any fielding error that allows a batter to reach base would indeed spoil a perfect game. However, it's important to note that a fielding error that does not allow a batter to reach base, such as a misplayed foul ball, does not count against the perfection of the game.",

These actions must involve a manifest intent to cause the company to sustain a loss and obtain an improper financial benefit, either for themselves or another party.\n\nOn the other hand, crime insurance is a broader category of insurance that covers various types of crimes such as burglary, fire, general theft, computer theft, disappearance, fraud, forgery, and more. While fidelity bonds are a subset of crime insurance, they are specifically tailored to protect against losses arising from employee dishonesty.\n\nSo, fidelity bonds are a type of crime insurance, but crime insurance encompasses a wider range of coverages beyond just employee dishonesty.

The killers, who were 10 years old at the time, were said to have imitated a scene in which one of Chucky's victims is splashed with blue paint. Although these allegations against the film have never been proven, the case has led to some new legislation for video films. Psychologist Guy Cumberbatch has stated, ``The link with a video was that the father of one of the boys -- Jon Venables -- had rented Child's Play 3: Look Who's Stalking some months earlier.'' However, the police officer who directed the investigation, Albert Kirby, found that the son, Jon, was not living with his father at the time and was unlikely to have seen the film. Moreover, the boy disliked horror films--a point later confirmed by psychiatric reports. Thus the police investigation, which had specifically looked for a video link, concluded there was none.

        "question": "Passage: Mal de debarquement (or mal de d\u00e9barquement) syndrome (MdDS, or common name disembarkment syndrome) is a neurological condition usually occurring after a cruise, aircraft flight, or other sustained motion event. The phrase ``mal de d\u00e9barquement'' is French and translates to ``illness of disembarkation''. MdDS is typically diagnosed by a neurologist or an ear nose & throat specialist when a person reports a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling (though they are not necessarily rocking). This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience. Because most vestibular testing proves to be negative, doctors may be baffled as they attempt to diagnose the syndrome. A major diagnostic indicator is that most patients feel better while driving or riding in a car, i.e.: while in passive motion. MdDS is unexplained by structural brain or inner ear pathology and most often corresponds with a motion trigger, although it can occur spontaneously. This differs from the very common condition of ``land sickness'' that most people feel for a short time after a motion event such as a boat cruise, aircraft ride, or even a treadmill routine which may only last minutes to a few hours. The syndrome has recently received increased attention due to the number of people presenting with the condition and more scientific research has commenced to determine what triggers MdDS and how to cure it. Question: is it normal to be dizzy after a cruise?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nIt is not normal to be dizzy after a cruise in the sense of experiencing persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing sensations, which are characteristic symptoms of Mal de D\u00e9barquement Syndrome (MdDS). While it is common for some individuals to experience temporary dizziness or a sensation of unsteadiness immediately after disembarking from a cruise or other motion-intensive experiences (often referred to as \"land sickness\"), this usually lasts for a short period, ranging from minutes to a few hours. It is a typical reaction of the body adjusting to stable ground after being in motion.\n\nMdDS, on the other hand, is a neurological condition that is characterized by prolonged and persistent feelings of rocking or swaying that persist long after the motion event has ended, such as a cruise or flight. This condition is not considered normal and may require medical evaluation and treatment.\n\nSo, it is important to distinguish between the temporary dizziness that some people may experience after a cruise, which is relatively common and short-lived, and the persistent symptoms associated with MdDS, which are not normal and should be addressed by a healthcare professional.",

Through increased prices and greater traffic, Transportation Investment Corporation (TI Corp), the public Crown corporation responsible for toll operations on the Port Mann Bridge, forecast its revenue would grow by 85% between fiscal years 2014 and 2017. These fees were assessed using radio-frequency identification (RFID) decals or licence plate photos. A B.C. licensed driver who owes more than $25 in tolls outstanding 90 days is penalized $20 and is unable to purchase vehicle insurance or renew drivers permits without payment of the debt. Out-of-province drivers were also contacted for payment by a US-based contractor. A licence plate processing fee of $2.30 per trip was added to the toll rate for unregistered users who did not pay their toll within seven days of their passage. Monthly passes, which allowed unlimited crossing on the bridge, were available for purchase. Users may have set up an account for online payment of tolls. Users who opted for this method received a decal with an embedded RFID to place on their vehicle's windshield or headlight and avoid paying a processing fee.

Resolution determines the overall size and clarity of the image. Higher resolution images have more pixels and can display more detail, but they may not necessarily have higher pixel density if the physical size of the display remains the same.\n\nIn summary, pixel density is a measure of how tightly pixels are packed in a given area, while resolution is a measure of the total number of pixels in an image.

That said, the real reason that ``999' was chosen is that the preferred ``000'' and ``111'' could not be used: ``111'' dialing could accidentally take place when phone lines were in too close proximity to each other, and ``0'' was already in use by the operator. Subscribers, as they were called then, were even given instructions on how to find the number ``9'' on the dial in darkened, or smoke-filled, rooms, by locating and placing the first finger in the ``0'' and the second in the ``9'', then removing the first when actually dialling. However, in modern times, where repeated sequences of numbers are easily accidentally dialled on mobile phones, this is problematic, as mobile phones will dial an emergency number while the keypad is locked or even without a SIM card. Some people have reported accidentally dialling 112 by loop-disconnect for various technical reasons, including while working on extension telephone wiring, and point to this as a disadvantage of the 112 emergency number, which takes only four loop disconnects to activate.

Emergency calls, such as 911 in the United States or 112 in many European countries, are typically routed through the cellular network even if the phone does not have an active SIM card. This is a safety feature to ensure that people can reach emergency services in critical situations, even if they don't have a working mobile plan or SIM card.\n\nThe passage you provided discusses the historical context of emergency numbers and the challenges associated with accidental dialing in older telephone systems. However, modern mobile phones are designed to allow emergency calls without a SIM card or with a locked keypad precisely to ensure that individuals can contact emergency services when needed. So, you can usually call the police or emergency services even without a SIM card in your mobile phone.",

        "question": "Passage: The redback is one of the few spider species that can be seriously harmful to humans, and its liking for habitats in built structures has led it to being responsible for a large number of serious spider bites in Australia. Predominantly neurotoxic to vertebrates, the venom gives rise to the syndrome of latrodectism in humans; this starts with pain around the bite site, which typically becomes severe and progresses up the bitten limb and persists for over 24 hours. Sweating in localised patches of skin occasionally occurs and is highly indicative of latrodectism. Generalised symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, and agitation may also occur and indicate severe envenomation. An antivenom has been available since 1956. There have been no deaths directly due to redback bites since its introduction, however Isbister et al. have suggested patients for whom antivenom is considered should be fully informed ``there is considerable weight of evidence to suggest it is no better than placebo'', and in light of a risk of anaphylaxis and serum sickness, ``routine use of the antivenom is therefore not recommended''. As of the 2013 (updated 2014) edition of the Snakebite & Spiderbite Clinical Management Guidelines from NSW HEALTH (latest available in 2017), Red-back spider bites were considered not life-threatening but capable of causing severe pain and systemic symptoms that could continue for hours to days.

        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation:\nInert gas and noble gas are related concepts, but they are not the same. The passage provides a good explanation of the distinction between the two:\n\n1. **Inert Gas**: An inert gas is a gas that does not undergo chemical reactions under specific conditions. Inert gases are used to prevent undesired chemical reactions that could degrade a sample. These reactions are typically oxidation and hydrolysis reactions with oxygen and moisture in the air. Inert gases are not limited to noble gases; other gases, such as nitrogen and argon, can also serve as inert gases because they do not react readily under certain conditions.\n\n2. **Noble Gas**: Noble gases, on the other hand, are a specific group of elements in the periodic table, including helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. Noble gases are characterized by their stability and reluctance to form chemical compounds. Historically, noble gases were often referred to as inert gases because they do not readily react with many substances. However, it's important to note that while noble gases are inert in many situations, they can still be made to react under specific conditions, as mentioned in the passage.\n\nSo, inert gases can include noble gases, but they are not limited to them. The term \"inert gas\" is context-dependent, and it can refer to any gas that does not readily undergo chemical reactions under certain conditions.

The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total 17 or more points. (At most tables the dealer also hits on a ``soft'' 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or not busting and having the dealer bust, or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack. If the player and dealer have the same total (not counting blackjacks), this is called a ``push'', and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand. Otherwise, the dealer wins. Question: does the dealer have to hit on 16?",

Attached to the N-acetylmuramic acid is a peptide chain of three to five amino acids. The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh-like layer. Peptidoglycan serves a structural role in the bacterial cell wall, giving structural strength, as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. A common misconception is that peptidoglycan gives the cell its shape; however, whereas peptidoglycan helps maintain the structural strength of the cell, it is actually the MreB protein that facilitates cell shape.

Miss Clement began umpiring while a student at Yankton College, and gained fame nationwide for her knowledge of baseball and her accuracy in umpiring the games. She was paid between $10 and $15 per game, which helped pay her tuition. She umpired games in North Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota until at least 1909, and later became a physical education instructor for high school and college women's teams. She still would umpire an occasional semi-pro game in South Dakota even during the 1910s. There were several other woman umpires in the early 1920s: one was Mrs. Deana Ernest of Toledo, Ohio, who umpired semi-pro games in the area, and also managed a city league team there. Another was Nina Belle Hurst, a resident of Sawtelle, California, who umpired in the Southern California Baseball Managers Association. During World War II, there were also some women who umpired, including some the press jokingly referred to as ``WUMPS'' (women umpires). Among them was Lorraine Heinisch, of Kenosha WI, who umpired semi-pro games in 1943, including a championship game in Wichita, Kansas. The first woman to umpire a professional game was Bernice Gera. A former Little League coach and a passionate fan of baseball, she entered umpiring school in 1967 (the first woman ever to attend the Fort Lauderdale Baseball School). After a lengthy court battle with major league baseball, she finally won the right to umpire. Her first pro game was in the minor leagues in June 1972--a game between the Auburn Phillies and Geneva Rangers in the New York-Penn League, but after several disputed calls, she decided to resign and never umpired another professional game.

The passage mentions that a crank sensor can be used as the primary source for measuring engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM). While the crankshaft sensor is indeed used to determine the position and speed of the crankshaft, which is a key component of measuring engine speed, it's not the same as an engine speed sensor.\n\nAn engine speed sensor, often referred to as a vehicle speed sensor (VSS) or simply a speed sensor, is responsible for measuring the speed of the entire vehicle, not just the engine's RPM.

The enzymes used in the saccharification step are supplied by an addition of sprouted barley grains to the rice starch (the traditional method) or by adding bacterial- or fungal-derived purified enzyme isolates (the modern, industrialized method). Question: is rice syrup the same as rice malt syrup?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nRice syrup and rice malt syrup are not the same. While both are sweeteners derived from rice, they have differences in their production processes and composition. \n\nRice syrup, also known as rice syrup, is made by culturing cooked rice starch with saccharifying enzymes to break down the starches. This process is often done with the addition of sprouted barley grains (the traditional method) or with bacterial- or fungal-derived purified enzyme isolates (the modern, industrialized method). The result is a syrup that is rich in sugars.\n\nOn the other hand, rice malt syrup, sometimes referred to as brown rice malt syrup, is a specific type of rice syrup that is derived from malted rice. Malted rice involves soaking and sprouting the rice grains, which activates enzymes that convert the starches in the rice into sugars. This malted rice is then processed to extract the syrup.\n\nSo, while both rice syrup and rice malt syrup are sweeteners made from rice, the key difference lies in the starting material and the enzymatic processes involved in their production.

It mentions drug addiction as an example. \n\nDrug tolerance, in the context of drug addiction, is typically caused by the opposite mechanism: downregulation of receptors. When a person becomes tolerant to a drug, it means that their body has adapted to the drug's presence, often by reducing the number or sensitivity of receptors targeted by the drug. This downregulation makes the person less responsive to the drug over time, leading to the need for higher doses to achieve the same effect. \n\nSo, drug tolerance is primarily associated with downregulation of receptors, not upregulation or epigenetic alterations.",

The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. The martingale strategy has been applied to roulette as well, as the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%. Question: can you keep doubling your bet on roulette?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nIn the context of the martingale betting strategy, it is not accurate to say that you can keep doubling your bet indefinitely in roulette. While the martingale strategy involves doubling your bet after every loss with the idea that eventually, you will win and recover all previous losses, there are significant limitations and risks involved:\n\n1. Table Limits: Most roulette tables in casinos have minimum and maximum betting limits. As you double your bet after each loss, you will quickly reach the maximum bet allowed at the table. When this happens, you can no longer double your bet, which breaks the martingale strategy.\n\n2. Bankroll Constraints: The martingale strategy assumes that you have an unlimited bankroll to continue doubling your bets. In reality, most gamblers have limited funds, and if you encounter a long losing streak, you may run out of money before a winning spin occurs.\n\n3. Risk of Ruin: The martingale strategy is highly risky. If you experience a series of consecutive losses, your bets can escalate rapidly, leading to substantial losses. This is known as the \"risk of ruin,\" where you can lose your entire bankroll without a winning spin.\n\n4. Lack of Guaranteed Wins: Roulette is a game of chance, and each spin is independent of the previous one. There is no guarantee that a winning spin will occur within a certain number of attempts, even if the odds of hitting red or black are close to 50%.\n\nIn summary, while the martingale strategy involves doubling bets after losses, it is not a foolproof or sustainable method for winning at roulette due to table limits, bankroll constraints, and the inherent risks involved in gambling. Players should approach roulette with caution and an understanding of the odds and probabilities involved.",

        "question": "Passage: In the popcorn industry, a popped kernel of corn is known as a ``flake.'' Two shapes of flakes are commercially important. ``Butterfly'' (or ``snowflake'') flakes are irregular in shape and have a number of protruding ``wings''. ``Mushroom'' flakes are largely ball-shaped, with few wings. Butterfly flakes are regarded as having better mouthfeel, with greater tenderness and less noticeable hulls. Mushroom flakes are less fragile than butterfly flakes and are therefore often used for packaged popcorn or confectionery, such as caramel corn. The kernels from a single cob of popcorn may form both butterfly and mushroom flakes; hybrids that produce 100% butterfly flakes or 100% mushroom flakes exist, the latter developed only as recently as 1998. Growing conditions and popping environment can also affect the butterfly-to-mushroom ratio. Question: is popcorn made from corn on the cob?",

The sizes most commonly in use today are the soprano (aka ``descant'', lowest note C), alto (aka ``treble'', lowest note F), tenor (lowest note C) and bass (lowest note F). Recorders are traditionally constructed from wood and ivory, while most recorders made in recent years are constructed from molded plastic. The recorders' internal and external proportions vary, but the bore is generally reverse conical (i.e. tapering towards the foot) to cylindrical, and all recorder fingering systems make extensive use of forked fingerings.

The passage explains that recorders come in different sizes, and the descant recorder is also known as the soprano recorder. However, it's important to note that while they share the same vocal range (with the lowest note being C), they are not identical.

It is an alternative to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Both modalities stent the lungs' alveoli open and thus recruit more of the lung's surface area for ventilation. But while PEEP refers to devices tvt impose positive pressure only at the end of the exhalation, CPAP devices apply continuous positive airway pressure throughout the breathing cycle. Thus, the ventilator itself does not cycle during CPAP, no additional pressure above the level of CPAP is provided, and patients must initiate all of their breaths. Question: is a cpap the same as a ventilator?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nA CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machine and a ventilator are not the same. While both are devices used to assist with breathing, they serve different purposes and operate differently.\n\nA CPAP machine is primarily used to treat sleep apnea and other sleep-related breathing disorders. It provides a continuous stream of air at a specific pressure level to help keep the airways open during sleep. CPAP is not designed to fully support or initiate breathing; instead, it assists individuals in maintaining regular breathing patterns during sleep.\n\nOn the other hand, a ventilator, also known as a mechanical ventilator or respirator, is a medical device used in healthcare settings to support or completely take over a patient's breathing when they are unable to do so adequately on their own. Ventilators can deliver controlled breaths to patients, including both inhalation and exhalation, and can be adjusted to provide varying levels of pressure and oxygen concentration.\n\nIn summary, a CPAP machine is a specific type of positive airway pressure device used for sleep-related breathing issues, while a ventilator is a more versatile medical device used in critical care situations to assist or control a patient's breathing.",

These are typically college basketball players, but international players are also eligible to be drafted. College players who have finished their four-year college eligibility are automatically eligible for selection, while the underclassmen have to declare their eligibility and give up their remaining college eligibility. International players who are at least 22 years old are automatically eligible for selection, while the players younger than 22 have to declare their eligibility. Players who are not automatically eligible but have declared their eligibility are often called ``early-entrants'' or ``early-entry candidates''. The draft usually takes place at the end of June, during the NBA offseason.

Also known generically as an ``optical audio cable'' or just ``optical cable'', its most common use is in consumer audio equipment (via a ``digital optical'' socket), where it carries a digital audio stream from components such as CD and DVD players, DAT recorders, computers, and modern video game consoles, to an AV receiver that can decode two channels of uncompressed lossless PCM audio or compressed 5.1/7.1 surround sound such as Dolby Digital or DTS Surround System. Unlike HDMI, TOSLINK does not have the bandwidth to carry the lossless versions of Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, or more than two channels of PCM audio. Question: is a digital audio cable the same as an optical cable?",

On the other hand, a digital audio cable can refer to various types of cables that transmit digital audio, including coaxial digital audio cables, which use electrical signals.\n\nSo, while an optical cable is a type of digital audio cable, it's not the only type, and they are not identical.

        "question": "Passage: In structural engineering, a shear wall is a structural system composed of braced panels (also known as shear panels) to counter the effects of lateral load acting on a structure. Wind and seismic loads are the most common building codes, including the International Building Code (where it is called a braced wall line) and Uniform Building Code, all exterior wall lines in wood or steel frame construction must be braced. Depending on the size of the building some interior walls must be braced as well. Question: is a shear wall a load bearing wall?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation:\nA shear wall is not necessarily a load-bearing wall in the traditional sense. A load-bearing wall is one that carries the vertical load of the structure, such as the weight of floors and roofs. Shear walls, on the other hand, primarily serve to counter lateral loads, such as wind or seismic forces, by resisting shear stresses and preventing excessive horizontal movement of a building.\n\nWhile shear walls play a crucial role in providing structural stability and preventing the building from swaying or collapsing under lateral loads, they may not always be the primary load-bearing elements of a structure. Load-bearing walls are typically designed to carry vertical loads, and their main purpose is to support the structure's weight.\n\nSo, a shear wall can be an important component of a building's structural system, but it is not necessarily a load-bearing wall in the conventional sense of supporting vertical loads.",

        "question": "Passage: It is important to note that mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison (immunity generally is only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to) and, depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, ie, on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. In some cases, it is possible to build up tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. For some poisons, this involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that deal with these poisons (for example alcohol). Another mechanism involves conditioning the target tissues of the poisons. These methods do not work for all non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, is either lethal or has little to no effect, and thus cannot be used in this way at all. Arsenic is a notable exception with some people actually having a genetic adaptation granting them higher resistance which can be replicated with mithridatism. In addition, simple toxins that work through chemical processes that bypass the immune system cannot be dealt with (good example would be the variants of cyanide). Question: can you build up an immunity to arsenic?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nMithridatism, the practice of gradually building immunity to poisons, is not generally effective against all types of poison.

Building immunity to arsenic, or any poison for that matter, is not a common or reliable outcome of mithridatism. The passage also emphasizes that results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, and exposure to certain toxic substances, like hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, may still be lethal or have little to no effect despite attempts at mithridatism. Therefore, building immunity to arsenic through mithridatism is not a guaranteed or widely applicable practice.",

It was originally a black-powder revolver round developed for the Colt Single Action Army revolver. This cartridge was adopted by the U.S. Army in 1873 and served as an official US military handgun cartridge for 14 years. While it is sometimes referred to as .45 Long Colt or .45 LC, to differentiate it from the very popular and ubiquitous .45 ACP, and historically, the shorter .45 S&W Schofield, it was only an unofficial designation by Army quartermasters.

It ranks below five of a kind and above four of a kind. As part of a straight flush, an ace can rank either above a king or below a two, depending on the rules of the game.

It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base.

Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero. Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the first law of thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero. For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case. Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible. Question: does temperature remain constant in an adiabatic process?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation:\nIn an adiabatic process, the temperature does not necessarily remain constant. The passage correctly mentions that for an ideal gas, in an adiabatic process, there is no heat transfer, but it doesn't guarantee that the temperature remains constant. Adiabatic processes involve changes in pressure and volume without heat exchange, and they can lead to temperature changes. The relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature in an adiabatic process is governed by the ideal gas law and the specific heat ratio (\u03b3), which can result in temperature changes.

The most common forms of these are in doctor--patient confidentiality (physician--patient privilege), attorney--client privilege, priest--penitent privilege, and bank--client confidentiality agreements. Question: is there a difference between a confidentiality agreement and a non disclosure agreement?",
        "pred_ans": "True\n\nConfidentiality agreements (CAs) and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are often used interchangeably and serve a similar purpose. Both types of agreements aim to protect confidential information by legally binding parties not to disclose it to third parties. However, there can be some nuanced differences in their scope and usage depending on legal jurisdictions and specific contexts.\n\nConfidentiality Agreement (CA):\n1. A confidentiality agreement is a broader term that encompasses various types of agreements designed to protect confidential information.\n2. It may be used in a wider range of scenarios beyond business settings, including those mentioned in the passage, such as doctor-patient, attorney-client, priest-penitent, and bank-client relationships.\n3.

An NDA is a specific type of confidentiality agreement that is often used in business and commercial contexts.\n2. It is more tailored to the protection of business-related confidential information, trade secrets, intellectual property, and proprietary data.\n3. NDAs typically include detailed provisions regarding the consequences of a breach, such as penalties, damages, or legal action.\n\nIn summary, while there is overlap between the two terms, a confidentiality agreement is a broader category that encompasses various types of agreements related to confidentiality.

It is also known by the genericized trademark Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. Thread seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed.

        "question": "Passage: The carbon-hydrogen bond (C--H bond) is a bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms that can be found in many organic compounds. This bond is a covalent bond meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens. This completes both of their outer shells making them stable. Carbon--hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 \u00c5 (1.09 \u00d7 10 m) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol (see table below). Using Pauling's scale--C (2.55) and H (2.2)--the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35. Because of this small difference in electronegativities, the C\u2212H bond is generally regarded as being non-polar. In structural formulas of molecules, the hydrogen atoms are often omitted. Compound classes consisting solely of C--H bonds and C--C bonds are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons. Question: can carbon form polar covalent bonds with hydrogen?",
        "pred_ans": "True\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage provides information about the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond, stating that it is generally regarded as being non-polar due to the small electronegativity difference between carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). The passage mentions that the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35, which is relatively small, and therefore, carbon can form non-polar covalent bonds with hydrogen.

While both are flat, rectangular metal pans used in ovens for baking, they have some differences in design and functionality.\n\nA sheet pan is a versatile kitchen tool that can be used for a wide range of purposes, including baking bread rolls, pastries, cookies, sheet cakes, swiss rolls, and pizzas. It typically has a shallow rim around the edges, which can help contain liquids or prevent items from sliding off.\n\nOn the other hand, a cookie sheet is specifically designed for baking cookies.

        "question": "Passage: A federal government is the common or national government of a federation. The United States is considered the first modern federation. After declaring independence from Britain, the U.S. adopted its first constitution, the Articles of Confederation in 1781. This was the first step towards federalism by establishing the confederal Congress. However, Congress was limited as to its ability to pursue economic, military, and judiciary reform. In 1787, a Constitutional Convention drafted the United States Constitution during the Philadelphia Convention. After the ratification of the Constitution by nine states in 1788, the U.S. was officially a federation, putting the U.S. in a unique position where the central government exists by the sufferance of the individual states rather than the reverse.

        "question": "Passage: The blood--brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the central nervous system (CNS). The blood--brain barrier is formed by brain endothelial cells and it allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function. Furthermore, it prevents the entry of lipophilic potential neurotoxins by way of an active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein. Astrocytes have been claimed to be necessary to create the blood--brain barrier. A few regions in the brain, including the circumventricular organs, do not have a blood--brain barrier. Question: can protein pass through the blood brain barrier?",
        "pred_ans": "True\n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) is indeed a highly selective semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the central nervous system (CNS). While it restricts the passage of many substances, including large molecules like proteins, there are specific mechanisms that allow certain molecules, such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial for neural function, to cross the BBB. These molecules typically require specialized transport systems to traverse the barrier.\n\nIn the context of the question, proteins generally do not pass through the BBB freely. However, there are exceptions where certain proteins can cross the BBB through specific transport mechanisms or under certain pathological conditions.

Robert's Rules says, ``If the law under which an organization is incorporated allows proxy voting to be prohibited by a provision of the bylaws, the adoption of this book as parliamentary authority by prescription in the bylaws should be treated as sufficient provision to accomplish that result''. Demeter says the same thing, but also states that ``if these laws do not prohibit voting by proxy, the body can pass a law permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired.'' RONR opines, ``Ordinarily it should neither be allowed nor required, because proxy voting is incompatible with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which membership is individual, personal, and nontransferable.

        "question": "Passage: Skeletal muscles are sheathed by a tough layer of connective tissue called the epimysium. The epimysium anchors muscle tissue to tendons at each end, where the epimysium becomes thicker and collagenous. It also protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones. Within the epimysium are multiple bundles called fascicles, each of which contains 10 to 100 or more muscle fibers collectively sheathed by a perimysium. Besides surrounding each fascicle, the perimysium is a pathway for nerves and the flow of blood within the muscle. The threadlike muscle fibers are the individual muscle cells (myocytes), and each cell is encased within its own endomysium of collagen fibers. Thus, the overall muscle consists of fibers (cells) that are bundled into fascicles, which are themselves grouped together to form muscles. At each level of bundling, a collagenous membrane surrounds the bundle, and these membranes support muscle function both by resisting passive stretching of the tissue and by distributing forces applied to the muscle. Scattered throughout the muscles are muscle spindles that provide sensory feedback information to the central nervous system. (This grouping structure is analogous to the organization of nerves which uses epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium). Question: are muscle fibers and muscle cells the same?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nMuscle fibers and muscle cells are not the same, although they are closely related. The passage provides a detailed explanation of the structure of skeletal muscles. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. Skeletal muscles are composed of muscle fibers.\n2. Muscle fibers are individual muscle cells (myocytes).\n3. Each muscle cell (myocyte) is encased within its own endomysium of collagen fibers.\n4. Muscle fibers (cells) are bundled into fascicles, which are groups of muscle fibers.\n5. The fascicles are surrounded by perimysium.\n6. The perimysium is a pathway for nerves and blood flow within the muscle.\n7. Collagenous membranes surround bundles at each level of bundling.\n\nSo, muscle fibers are the individual muscle cells (myocytes) encased within their own collagenous endomysium, while muscle cells refer to these individual units. They are not exactly the same, as muscle fibers are part of the larger structural organization of muscle tissue.",

        "question": "Passage: The Ring of Fire is a direct result of plate tectonics: the movement and collisions of lithospheric plates. The eastern section of the ring is the result of the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate being subducted beneath the westward-moving South American Plate. The Cocos Plate is being subducted beneath the Caribbean Plate, in Central America. A portion of the Pacific Plate and the small Juan de Fuca Plate are being subducted beneath the North American Plate. Along the northern portion, the northwestward-moving Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the Aleutian Islands arc. Farther west, the Pacific plate is being subducted along the Kamchatka Peninsula arcs on south past Japan. The southern portion is more complex, with a number of smaller tectonic plates in collision with the Pacific plate from the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Bougainville, Tonga, and New Zealand; this portion excludes Australia, since it lies in the center of its tectonic plate. Indonesia lies between the Ring of Fire along the northeastern islands adjacent to and including New Guinea and the Alpide belt along the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores, and Timor.

On opening night of the 2010 season at Fenway Park, the song was performed by Diamond himself. ``Sweet Caroline'' was played at Penn State Nittany Lions football games at Beaver Stadium until August 2012, halting after the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. Performances at Beaver Stadium resumed in September 2013, however. The song is played at the start of the fourth quarter of Pittsburgh Panthers Football games at Heinz Field. In response, West Virginia University students and fans will yell ``eat shit, Pitt'' during the refrain if heard played.

        "question": "Passage: There is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from a goal kick, a corner kick, a throw-in, or a dropped ball. It is also not an offence if the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent (except for a deliberate save). In this context, according to the IFAB, ``A 'save' is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms (unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area).'' Question: can a player be offsides on a throw in?",
        "pred_ans": "Background Context:\nOffside is a rule in football (soccer) that prohibits players from gaining an unfair advantage by standing closer to the opponent's goal than the second last defender when the ball is played to them, with some exceptions. One of the main reasons for this rule is to promote fair play and prevent goal-hanging. The passage you provided outlines some of these exceptions.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. The rules stated in the passage align with the official rules as outlined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).\n2. The question asks specifically about the throw-in scenario and not about the other scenarios mentioned in the passage.\n\nStep-by-step Thinking:\n1. The passage mentions that \"There is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from a goal kick, a corner kick, a throw-in, or a dropped ball.\"\n2. Therefore, if a player receives the ball directly from a throw-in, they cannot be deemed offside according to this rule.\n\nAnswer:\nTrue",

In loose form, it is (in ratio with or without corn starch) one of the most widely used substances known as baby powder. It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses, and in an exceptionally rare crystal form. It has a perfect basal cleavage, and the folia are not elastic, although slightly flexible. Question: is talc and talcum powder the same thing?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation: Talc and talcum powder are related but not exactly the same thing. Talc is a naturally occurring clay mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silicate, as mentioned in the passage. Talcum powder, on the other hand, is a product made by grinding and processing talc into a fine powder. Talcum powder often includes other ingredients, such as cornstarch, to improve its texture and absorbency. While talcum powder is derived from talc, it is a specific product created for various uses, including as a cosmetic and personal care product, while talc itself exists in different forms and can have various applications.

        "question": "Passage: Stimuli-responsive gels (hydrogels, when the swelling agent is an aqueous solution) are a special kind of swellable polymer networks with volume phase transition behaviour. These materials change reversibly their volume, optical, mechanical and other properties by very small alterations of certain physical (e.g. electric field, light, temperature) or chemical (concentrations) stimuli. The volume change of these materials occurs by swelling/shrinking and is diffusion-based. Gels provide the biggest change in volume of solid-state materials. Combined with an excellent compatibility with micro fabrication technologies, especially stimuli-responsive hydrogels are of strong increasing interest for microsystems with sensors and actuators. Current fields of research and application are chemical sensor systems, microfluidics and multimodal imaging systems. Question: is there a material that contracts with electricity?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nThe passage mentions that stimuli-responsive gels can change their properties in response to various stimuli, including physical factors like electric fields. However, it doesn't specifically state that these gels contract in response to electricity. The passage mentions changes in volume, optical properties, and mechanical properties but does not mention contraction specifically in response to electricity. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that there is a material mentioned in the passage that contracts with electricity.",

Although he was survived by a son and daughter by Lady Augusta Murray, their marriage had been annulled for lack of royal permission under the Royal Marriages Act 1772, rendering the children illegitimate under English law and unable to inherit titles from their father.

This sort of rain is said to take on the form of a fine, light drizzle, typically after dusk. The name derives from French serein, meaning ``serene'', or ``clear'' (as in unclouded). An alternative etymology is from Old French serain, evening. Question: can it rain if there are no clouds?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation: While the passage mentions the term \"serein,\" which refers to rain falling from a cloudless sky, it's important to note that this phenomenon is relatively rare and occurs under specific conditions. In most cases, rain is associated with the presence of clouds, as they contain the moisture that condenses and falls as precipitation. However, under unique atmospheric conditions, such as with serein, it is possible to experience rain even when there are no visible clouds. So, the statement is generally false, but there are exceptions like serein where it can occur.",
