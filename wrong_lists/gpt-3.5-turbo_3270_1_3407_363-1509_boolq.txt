        "question": "Passage: A queen ant (formally known as a gyne) is an adult, reproducing female ant in an ant colony; generally she will be the mother of all the other ants in that colony. Some female ants, such as Cataglyphis cursor, do not need to mate to produce offspring, reproducing through asexual parthenogenesis or cloning, and all of those offspring will be female. Others, like those in the genus Crematogaster, mate in a nuptial flight. Queen offspring develop from larvae specially fed in order to become sexually mature among most species. Depending on the species, there can be either a single mother queen, or potentially, hundreds of fertile queens in some species. Queen ants have one of the longest life-spans of any known insect -- up to 30 years. A queen of Lasius niger was held in captivity by German entomologist Hermann Appel for 283\u20444 years; also a Pogonomyrmex owyheei has a maximum estimated longevity of 30 years in the field.

Ford released the original model in 2000 for the 2001 model year--a model jointly developed and released with Mazda of Japan--who took a lead in the engineering of the two models and sold their version as the Mazda Tribute. Although the Escape and Tribute share the same underpinnings constructed from the Ford CD2 platform (based on Mazda GF underpinnings), the only panels common to the two vehicles are the roof and floor pressings. Powertrains were supplied by Mazda with respect to the base inline-four engine, with Ford providing the optional V6. At first, the twinned models were assembled by Ford in the US for North American consumption, with Mazda in Japan supplying cars for other markets. This followed a long history of Mazda-derived Fords, starting with the Ford Courier in the 1970s. Ford also sold the first generation Escape in Europe and China as the Ford Maverick, replacing the previous Nissan-sourced model. Then in 2004, for the 2005 model year, Ford's luxury Mercury division released a rebadged version called the Mercury Mariner, sold mainly in North America. The first iteration Escape remains notable as the first SUV to offer a hybrid drivetrain option, released in 2004 for the 2005 model year to North American markets only.

The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language (sometimes abbreviated as GSD). The breed is known as the Alsatian in Britain and Ireland. The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting. The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom.

        "question": "Passage: Because of loop disconnect dialing, attention was devoted to making the numbers difficult to dial accidentally by making them involve long sequences of pulses, such as with the UK 999 emergency number. That said, the real reason that ``999' was chosen is that the preferred ``000'' and ``111'' could not be used: ``111'' dialing could accidentally take place when phone lines were in too close proximity to each other, and ``0'' was already in use by the operator. Subscribers, as they were called then, were even given instructions on how to find the number ``9'' on the dial in darkened, or smoke-filled, rooms, by locating and placing the first finger in the ``0'' and the second in the ``9'', then removing the first when actually dialling. However, in modern times, where repeated sequences of numbers are easily accidentally dialled on mobile phones, this is problematic, as mobile phones will dial an emergency number while the keypad is locked or even without a SIM card. Some people have reported accidentally dialling 112 by loop-disconnect for various technical reasons, including while working on extension telephone wiring, and point to this as a disadvantage of the 112 emergency number, which takes only four loop disconnects to activate.

The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage.

A major diagnostic indicator is that most patients feel better while driving or riding in a car, i.e.: while in passive motion. MdDS is unexplained by structural brain or inner ear pathology and most often corresponds with a motion trigger, although it can occur spontaneously. This differs from the very common condition of ``land sickness'' that most people feel for a short time after a motion event such as a boat cruise, aircraft ride, or even a treadmill routine which may only last minutes to a few hours. The syndrome has recently received increased attention due to the number of people presenting with the condition and more scientific research has commenced to determine what triggers MdDS and how to cure it. Question: is it normal to have motion sickness after a cruise?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nMotion sickness, commonly referred to as \"land sickness\" in the passage, is a common condition that many people experience for a short time after a motion event such as a boat cruise. However, the passage describes a different condition called Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS), which is not the same as normal motion sickness. MdDS is a neurological condition that typically occurs after a cruise or other sustained motion event and is characterized by persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing sensations. It is not considered normal to have MdDS-like symptoms after a cruise, as MdDS is a specific and less common condition.",

        "question": "Passage: A non-disclosure agreement (NDA), also known as a confidentiality agreement (CA), confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA) or secrecy agreement (SA), is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. The most common forms of these are in doctor--patient confidentiality (physician--patient privilege), attorney--client privilege, priest--penitent privilege, and bank--client confidentiality agreements. Question: is there a difference between a confidentiality agreement and a non disclosure agreement?",
        "pred_ans": "True\n\nConfidentiality agreements (CAs) and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are often used interchangeably, and there is a significant overlap in their purpose and function. Both types of agreements are legal contracts between two or more parties that outline the protection of confidential information. They are used to safeguard sensitive information and restrict access to it by third parties.\n\nHowever, there can be subtle differences in how these terms are used in specific contexts. A confidentiality agreement may be a broader term that encompasses any agreement aimed at protecting confidential information. On the other hand, an NDA is often associated with specific situations, such as when a party is disclosing sensitive information to another party for a particular purpose, like during a business negotiation or a research collaboration.\n\nIn practice, the choice between using \"confidentiality agreement\" or \"non-disclosure agreement\" can depend on legal preferences, regional variations, or the specific nature of the information being protected. So, while they are very similar and often used interchangeably, there can be nuanced distinctions in certain contexts.",

They tend to be time-related, such as salaries or rents being paid per month, and are often referred to as overhead costs. This is in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related (and are paid per quantity produced). For a simple example, such as a bakery, the monthly rent for the baking facilities, and the monthly payments for the security system and basic phone line are fixed costs, as they do not change according to how much bread the bakery produces and sells. On the other hands, the wage costs of the bakery are variable, as the bakery will have to hire more workers if the production of bread increases. The relation between fixed cost and variable cost can be modelled by an analytical formula. Question: are fixed costs and overhead costs the same?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nFixed costs and overhead costs are related concepts in economics, but they are not exactly the same. The passage provides a good explanation of the differences between the two:\n\nFixed costs, indirect costs, or overheads are business expenses that do not depend on the level of goods or services produced. These costs tend to be time-related, such as salaries or rents paid per month.

The epimysium anchors muscle tissue to tendons at each end, where the epimysium becomes thicker and collagenous. It also protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones. Within the epimysium are multiple bundles called fascicles, each of which contains 10 to 100 or more muscle fibers collectively sheathed by a perimysium. Besides surrounding each fascicle, the perimysium is a pathway for nerves and the flow of blood within the muscle. The threadlike muscle fibers are the individual muscle cells (myocytes), and each cell is encased within its own endomysium of collagen fibers. Thus, the overall muscle consists of fibers (cells) that are bundled into fascicles, which are themselves grouped together to form muscles. At each level of bundling, a collagenous membrane surrounds the bundle, and these membranes support muscle function both by resisting passive stretching of the tissue and by distributing forces applied to the muscle.

The toll rates increased to $1.60 for motorcycle, $3.15 for cars, $6.30 for small trucks and $9.45 for large trucks on August 15, 2015. Through increased prices and greater traffic, Transportation Investment Corporation (TI Corp), the public Crown corporation responsible for toll operations on the Port Mann Bridge, forecast its revenue would grow by 85% between fiscal years 2014 and 2017. These fees were assessed using radio-frequency identification (RFID) decals or licence plate photos. A B.C. licensed driver who owes more than $25 in tolls outstanding 90 days is penalized $20 and is unable to purchase vehicle insurance or renew drivers permits without payment of the debt. Out-of-province drivers were also contacted for payment by a US-based contractor. A licence plate processing fee of $2.30 per trip was added to the toll rate for unregistered users who did not pay their toll within seven days of their passage. Monthly passes, which allowed unlimited crossing on the bridge, were available for purchase. Users may have set up an account for online payment of tolls. Users who opted for this method received a decal with an embedded RFID to place on their vehicle's windshield or headlight and avoid paying a processing fee. Tolls were expected to be removed by the year of 2050 or after collecting $3.3 billion. As announced by B.C. Premier John Horgan a few days earlier, all tolls on the Port Mann Bridge were removed on September 1, 2017.

        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation: A shear wall is not necessarily a load-bearing wall in the traditional sense. While it does provide structural support and helps counter the effects of lateral loads such as wind and seismic forces, it is primarily designed to resist shear forces, which are forces parallel to the plane of the wall. Load-bearing walls, on the other hand, support vertical loads from the building's structure, such as the weight of the floors and roof.\n\nIn structural engineering, load-bearing walls are typically designed to carry vertical loads, while shear walls are designed to resist horizontal forces.

Pipelining attempts to keep every part of the processor busy with some instruction by dividing incoming instructions into a series of sequential steps (the eponymous ``pipeline'') performed by different processor units with different parts of instructions processed in parallel. It allows faster CPU throughput than would otherwise be possible at a given clock rate, but may increase latency due to the added overhead of the pipelining process itself. Question: can pipelining help latency of a single task?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nPipelining, as described in the passage, is primarily aimed at improving CPU throughput by allowing multiple instructions to be processed in parallel. While it can indeed lead to faster CPU throughput, it typically does not reduce latency for an individual task. In fact, pipelining can increase latency due to the added overhead of breaking instructions into sequential steps and managing the pipeline.\n\nReducing latency for a single task often requires different techniques, such as optimizing the algorithm, minimizing memory access times, or reducing contention for resources. Pipelining is more about improving the overall efficiency of the processor by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions, which is beneficial for throughput but may not directly address latency for a single task.",

The mechanical advantage of the wheel and axle is the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to the applied loads, or what is the same thing the ratio of the diameter of the wheel and axle.

        "pred_ans": "False\n\nA wheel and axle cannot be directly called a lever, although they share some similarities in their mechanical principles. In a lever, a rigid bar pivots around a fixed point (fulcrum) to transmit a force from one end to another. In contrast, a wheel and axle system consists of a wheel (a circular object) and an axle (a rod that passes through the center of the wheel). While both mechanisms involve the transfer of force, the fundamental design and operation are different.\n\nIn a wheel and axle, a drive force is applied tangentially to the wheel's perimeter, and a load force is applied to the axle, with both forces balanced around the fulcrum. The mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle is determined by the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to the applied loads, which is essentially the ratio of the wheel's diameter to the axle's diameter.\n\nSo, while there are similarities in the concept of transferring force, a wheel and axle is a distinct mechanical arrangement and should not be directly referred to as a lever.",

It implies that the central bank does not affect the real economy (e.g., the number of jobs, the size of real GDP, the amount of real investment) by creating money.

However, Superman's memories have not returned, and he attacks the group after Stone accidentally launches a projectile at him. On the verge of being killed by Superman, Batman enacts his contingency plan: Lois Lane. Superman calms down and leaves with Lane to his family home in Smallville, where he reflects and his memories slowly come back. In the turmoil, the last Mother Box is left unguarded and Steppenwolf retrieves it with ease. Without Superman to aid them, the five heroes travel to a village in Russia where Steppenwolf aims to unite the Mother Boxes once again to remake Earth. The team fights their way through the Parademons to reach Steppenwolf, although they are unable to distract him enough for Stone to separate the Mother boxes.

The ability of teams to win a game purely on goals from scrum penalties was also seen as unfair. In an effort to improve this situation, changes to rules and their enforcement were made. The number of scrums was reduced with the introduction of the ``handover'' after a team has used a set of six tackles, the differential penalty, one which cannot be kicked at goal was brought in for offences at scrums and referees ceased enforcing some rules regarding feeding the ball into scrum.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are found on skeletal muscle, but also within the route of transmission for the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system (which together comprise the autonomic nervous system). More specifically, nicotinic receptors are found within the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system, allowing outgoing signals to be transmitted from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cells. Thus, for example, blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors blocks both sympathetic (excitatory) and parasympathetic (calming) stimulation of the heart. The nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium, for example, does this by blocking the transmission of outgoing signals across the autonomic ganglia at the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

This bond is a covalent bond meaning that carbon shares its outer valence electrons with up to four hydrogens. This completes both of their outer shells making them stable. Carbon--hydrogen bonds have a bond length of about 1.09 \u00c5 (1.09 \u00d7 10 m) and a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol (see table below). Using Pauling's scale--C (2.55) and H (2.2)--the electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.35. Because of this small difference in electronegativities, the C\u2212H bond is generally regarded as being non-polar. In structural formulas of molecules, the hydrogen atoms are often omitted. Compound classes consisting solely of C--H bonds and C--C bonds are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Collectively they are known as hydrocarbons. Question: can carbon form polar covalent bonds with hydrogen?",

Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. In this case, the electronegativity difference between C and H is mentioned as 0.35, which is relatively small. When the electronegativity difference is small, the bond formed is typically non-polar covalent, meaning that the electrons are shared equally between the atoms.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, carbon can form non-polar covalent bonds with hydrogen.",

        "question": "Passage: Chroma key compositing, or chroma keying, is a visual effects/post-production technique for compositing (layering) two images or video streams together based on color hues (chroma range). The technique has been used heavily in many fields to remove a background from the subject of a photo or video -- particularly the newscasting, motion picture and videogame industries. A color range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in video production and post-production. This technique is also referred to as color keying, colour-separation overlay (CSO; primarily by the BBC), or by various terms for specific color-related variants such as green screen, and blue screen -- chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any color that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from most human skin colors. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the color used as the backing. Question: can you use a white background as a green screen?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nChroma key compositing, commonly known as green screen or blue screen, relies on the principle of isolating a specific color range from the foreground footage to make it transparent and replace it with another background. While green and blue backgrounds are most commonly used due to their distinct hues that differ from human skin tones, theoretically, you can use a white background for chroma keying. However, using a white background for this purpose can be challenging for several reasons:\n\n1. Lack of color contrast: White does not provide a strong color contrast compared to green or blue. It may be more challenging to separate the subject from the background effectively.\n\n2. Spill and reflection: When using white as a background, there's a higher risk of color spill or reflection onto the subject, making it difficult to achieve a clean separation.\n\n3. Uniformity: Chroma key backgrounds need to be uniform and distinct, with consistent color throughout. White backgrounds can have shadows, gradients, or imperfections that may not work well for chroma keying.\n\n4. Duplication of color: The fundamental rule of chroma keying is that no part of the subject being filmed should duplicate the color used as the backing. With a white background, it's more challenging to ensure that the subject doesn't have any white elements, like clothing or props.\n\nIn professional video production, green and blue backgrounds are preferred because they offer better contrast and ease of use for chroma keying. While white backgrounds can technically be used, they are less common and come with added challenges.",

In the town of Chapel Hill, open carry is restricted to guns of a certain minimum size, under the theory that small, concealable handguns are more often associated with criminal activity. No permit is required to carry a handgun openly in North Carolina. In the court case of State v. Kerner(1921) the defendant ended up getting into some type of confrontation with another man. The defendant proceeded to walk back to his place of work, get his gun, and then return to the scene to fight. The defendant ended up being charged with ``carrying a concealed weapon'' and ``carrying his pistol off his premises unconcealed,'' which violated a local act applicable to Forsyth County and ended up being a misdemeanor. The defendant was taken to trial and the trial judge then dismissed the charge as unconstitutional. The state then appealed, and the supreme court affirmed. During court, the court stated at the beginning that the Second Amendment did not apply, because ``the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are restrictions on the federal authority and not the states.'' Therefore, with that being said, it focused more on the state constitution. The state constitution states that: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The court viewed the provision as protecting the right to carry arms in public. Forsyth County's local act was condemned and seen as distasteful, because it ended up putting a restriction on a persons right to carry a pistol, more so an unconcealed pistol. Although, the case of State v. Kerner helped/made more clear the allowance of openly carrying a pistol, it does not preclude all regulations regarding the carrying of firearms.

        "question": "Passage: A harmonic damper is a device fitted to the free (accessory drive) end of the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine to counter torsional and resonance vibrations from the crankshaft. This device must be interference fit to the crankshaft in order to operate in an effective manner. An interference fit ensures the device moves in perfect step with crankshaft. It is essential on engines with long crankshafts (such as straight-8 engines) and V8 engines with cross plane cranks. Harmonics and torsional vibrations can greatly reduce crankshaft life, or cause instantaneous failure if the crankshaft runs at or through an amplified resonance. Dampers are designed with a specific weight (mass) which is dependent on the damping material/method used and the freedom it affords the mass move allowing to reduce mechanical Q factor, or damp, crankshaft resonances. A harmonic balancer (sometimes crankshaft damper, torsional damper, or vibration damper) is the same thing as a harmonic damper except that the balancer includes a counterweight to externally balance the rotating assembly. The harmonic balancer often serves as a pulley for the accessory drive belts turning the alternator, water pump and other crankshaft driven devices. Question: is crankshaft pulley and harmonic balancer the same thing?",

In addition to its vibration-dampening function, it may also serve as a pulley for accessory drive belts, as mentioned in the passage.\n\nOn the other hand, a crankshaft pulley, sometimes referred to as a crankshaft or accessory drive pulley, is primarily a component used to drive various accessories in the engine, such as the alternator, water pump, and power steering pump. While it can be part of the harmonic balancer assembly in some engines, it's not the same as a harmonic balancer. The key difference is that the harmonic balancer includes the additional function of vibration dampening, which a regular crankshaft pulley does not.\n\nSo, a crankshaft pulley and a harmonic balancer are related but serve different purposes, with the harmonic balancer having an additional role in reducing vibrations.",

        "question": "Passage: The blood--brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the central nervous system (CNS). The blood--brain barrier is formed by brain endothelial cells and it allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function. Furthermore, it prevents the entry of lipophilic potential neurotoxins by way of an active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein. Astrocytes have been claimed to be necessary to create the blood--brain barrier. A few regions in the brain, including the circumventricular organs, do not have a blood--brain barrier. Question: can protein pass through the blood brain barrier?",
        "pred_ans": "True\n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable membrane barrier that regulates the passage of various substances between the circulating blood and the brain's extracellular fluid. While it is designed to be highly restrictive to protect the brain, some molecules, including certain proteins, can pass through the BBB, but this passage is tightly regulated.\n\nProteins can cross the BBB through several mechanisms, including:\n\n1. **Transport Proteins:** Some proteins, like glucose and amino acids that are essential for neural function, have specific transport proteins that facilitate their passage through the BBB. These transport mechanisms ensure that these crucial nutrients reach the brain.\n\n2. **Receptor-Mediated Transcytosis:** This process involves proteins binding to specific receptors on the surface of brain endothelial cells. Once bound, the proteins are internalized and transported across the BBB.\n\n3. **Active Transport Mechanisms:** As mentioned in the passage, P-glycoprotein is involved in actively transporting certain substances, including potentially neurotoxic lipophilic molecules, out of the brain. This active transport helps protect the brain from harmful compounds.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the BBB is highly selective, and not all proteins can freely pass through. Large or complex proteins may have difficulty crossing the barrier. Additionally, the BBB's permeability can be altered under certain conditions, such as inflammation or disease, allowing some proteins to pass more easily. Therefore, whether a specific protein can pass through the BBB depends on various factors, including its size, structure, and the presence of transport mechanisms.",

        "question": "Passage: The redback is one of the few spider species that can be seriously harmful to humans, and its liking for habitats in built structures has led it to being responsible for a large number of serious spider bites in Australia. Predominantly neurotoxic to vertebrates, the venom gives rise to the syndrome of latrodectism in humans; this starts with pain around the bite site, which typically becomes severe and progresses up the bitten limb and persists for over 24 hours. Sweating in localised patches of skin occasionally occurs and is highly indicative of latrodectism. Generalised symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, and agitation may also occur and indicate severe envenomation. An antivenom has been available since 1956. There have been no deaths directly due to redback bites since its introduction, however Isbister et al. have suggested patients for whom antivenom is considered should be fully informed ``there is considerable weight of evidence to suggest it is no better than placebo'', and in light of a risk of anaphylaxis and serum sickness, ``routine use of the antivenom is therefore not recommended''. As of the 2013 (updated 2014) edition of the Snakebite & Spiderbite Clinical Management Guidelines from NSW HEALTH (latest available in 2017), Red-back spider bites were considered not life-threatening but capable of causing severe pain and systemic symptoms that could continue for hours to days. Question: can a red back spider bite kill you?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nA redback spider bite is generally not considered lethal to humans. While their venom is potent and can cause severe pain, as well as a range of symptoms such as sweating, nausea, vomiting, headache, and agitation, it is rarely fatal. An antivenom has been available since 1956, and there have been no reported deaths directly attributed to redback spider bites since its introduction.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the effectiveness of the antivenom has been debated, with some suggesting that it may not be significantly better than a placebo. Therefore, routine use of the antivenom is not recommended due to the risk of side effects like anaphylaxis and serum sickness. In most cases, the symptoms of a redback spider bite can be managed without the need for antivenom, and fatalities are extremely rare.",

        "question": "Passage: In most countries, grade retention has been banned or strongly discouraged. In the United States, grade retention can be used in kindergarten through twelfth grade, however, students in grades seven through twelve are usually only retained in the specific failed subject due to each subject having its own specific classroom rather than staying in one classroom with all subjects taught for the entire school day as it is in grades kindergarten through sixth grade. For example, in grades seven through twelve, a student can be promoted in a math class but retained in a language class. Single classroom grades kindergarten through sixth grade are confined to one room for the whole day, being taught all subjects in the same classroom usually by one teacher with the exception of art and gymnastics conducted in the art room and the gymnasium respectively. In these grades the student must generally fail or score well below the accepted level in most or all areas within the entire curriculum to be retained. The student will then again repeat the entire school year within a single classroom and repeating the same subject matter as the previous year. Question: can you get held back in freshman year?",

In the town of Chapel Hill, open carry is restricted to guns of a certain minimum size, under the theory that small, concealable handguns are more often associated with criminal activity. No permit is required to carry a handgun openly in North Carolina. In the court case of State v. Kerner(1921) the defendant ended up getting into some type of confrontation with another man. The defendant proceeded to walk back to his place of work, get his gun, and then return to the scene to fight. The defendant ended up being charged with ``carrying a concealed weapon'' and ``carrying his pistol off his premises unconcealed,'' which violated a local act applicable to Forsyth County and ended up being a misdemeanor. The defendant was taken to trial and the trial judge then dismissed the charge as unconstitutional. The state then appealed, and the supreme court affirmed. During court, the court stated at the beginning that the Second Amendment did not apply, because ``the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are restrictions on the federal authority and not the states.'' Therefore, with that being said, it focused more on the state constitution. The state constitution states that: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' The court viewed the provision as protecting the right to carry arms in public. Forsyth County's local act was condemned and seen as distasteful, because it ended up putting a restriction on a persons right to carry a pistol, more so an unconcealed pistol. Although, the case of State v. Kerner helped/made more clear the allowance of openly carrying a pistol, it does not preclude all regulations regarding the carrying of firearms.

        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage explains that the standard error (SE) is related to the standard deviation, but they are not the same thing.\n\n- Standard Deviation (SD): This is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of data points. It quantifies how much individual data points vary from the mean (average) of the data. It's a measure of the variability within a dataset.\n\n- Standard Error (SE): The standard error, on the other hand, is a measure of the variability of a statistic (usually an estimate of a parameter) due to sampling variability. In other words, it tells us how much the estimate is likely to vary if we were to take multiple samples from the same population. When dealing with the mean, it's specifically referred to as the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM).\n\nSo, while both standard error and standard deviation are measures of variability, they serve different purposes.

Miss Clement began umpiring while a student at Yankton College, and gained fame nationwide for her knowledge of baseball and her accuracy in umpiring the games. She was paid between $10 and $15 per game, which helped pay her tuition. She umpired games in North Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota until at least 1909, and later became a physical education instructor for high school and college women's teams.

The tract may also be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological origin of each segment. The whole human GI tract is about nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy. It is considerably shorter in the living body because the intestines, which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone in a halfway-tense state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention and peristalsis.

All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure. The total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel is known as the energy balance (or ``energy returned on energy invested''). Figures compiled in a 2007 report by National Geographic Magazine point to modest results for corn ethanol produced in the US: one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. The energy balance for sugarcane ethanol produced in Brazil is more favorable, with one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol. Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory. For instance, a separate survey reports that production of ethanol from sugarcane, which requires a tropical climate to grow productively, returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended, as compared to corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended.

        "question": "Passage: Property tax or 'house tax' is a local tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets. Question: is house tax and property tax are same?",

Property tax is imposed on the possessor of the property, not the custodian, and it is based on factors such as annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. This tax is typically accompanied by service taxes for services like water, drainage, conservancy (sanitation), and lighting, all using the same tax base.\n\nOn the other hand, house tax specifically refers to a tax on residential properties or houses. While house tax is a type of property tax, it is more specific in its scope, focusing on residential properties. So, they are related concepts but not the same.",

The arrangement transpired after a bargain for his blood that would cure Damon of the werewolf bite he had received from Tyler. At first, he is reluctant to involve Elena in the rescue attempts, employing Alaric Saltzman, Elena's guardian, instead as Klaus does not know that Elena is alive after the sacrifice which frees Klaus' hybrid side. However, Elena involves herself, desperate to find Stefan. Damon, though hesitant at first, is unable to refuse her because of his love for her. He also points out to her that she once turned back from finding Stefan since she knew Damon would be in danger, clearly showing that she also has feelings for him. He tells her that ``when (he) drag(s) (his) brother from the edge to deliver him back to (her), (he) wants her to remember the things (she) felt while he was gone.'' When Stefan finally returns to Mystic Falls, his attitude is different from that of the first and second seasons. This causes a rift between Elena and Stefan whereas the relationship between Damon and Elena becomes closer and more intimate. A still loyal Elena, however, refuses to admit her feelings for Damon. In 'Dangerous Liaisons', Elena, frustrated with her feelings for him, tells Damon that his love for her may be a problem, and that this could be causing all their troubles. This incenses Damon, causing him to revert to the uncaring and reckless Damon seen in the previous seasons. The rocky relationship between the two continues until the sexual tension hits the fan and in a moment of heated passion, Elena -- for the first time in the three seasons -- kisses Damon of her own accord. This kiss finally causes Elena to admit that she loves both brothers and realize that she must ultimately make her choice as her own ancestress, Katherine Pierce, who turned the brothers, once did. In assessment of her feelings for Damon, she states this: ``Damon just sort of snuck up on me. He got under my skin and no matter what I do, I can't shake him.'' In the season finale, a trip designed to get her to safety forces Elena to make her choice: to go to Damon and possibly see him one last time; or to go to Stefan and her friends and see them one last time. She chooses the latter when she calls Damon to tell him her decision. Damon, who is trying to stop Alaric, accepts what she says and she tells him that maybe if she had met Damon before she had met Stefan, her choice may have been different. This statement causes Damon to remember the first night he did meet Elena which was, in fact, the night her parents died - before she had met Stefan. Not wanting anyone to know he was in town and after giving her some advice about life and love, Damon compels her to forget. He remembers this as he fights Alaric and seems accepting of his death when Alaric, whose life line is tied to Elena's, suddenly collapses in his arms. Damon is grief-stricken, knowing that this means that Elena has also died and yells, ``No! You are not dead!''

For example, when the temperature is 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) with 70% relative humidity, the heat index is 41 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F).

The willingness of issuing authorities in California ranges from No Issue in most urban areas to Shall Issue in rural counties. Additionally, the issuing authority can also impose restrictions on the CCW permit-holder, such as limiting concealed carry only to the purposes listed on the approved CCW permit application. However, concealed carry permits are valid statewide, regardless of where they were issued. This creates a situation where residents in presumptively No Issue locations such as Los Angeles and San Francisco cannot lawfully carry a concealed firearm, but residents from other counties with more permissive CCW issuance policies can lawfully carry within these same jurisdictions. California does not recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states, and non-residents are generally forbidden from obtaining a California concealed carry permit.

Question: can you carry a gun on you in california?",
        "pred_ans": "The question of whether you can carry a gun on your person in California is nuanced due to the state's concealed carry laws. In California, concealed carry permits are issued on a \"may issue\" basis, which means that the issuing authorities have discretion in granting these permits. The willingness of issuing authorities varies across the state. In some urban areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco, permits are rarely issued, effectively creating a situation where concealed carry is not allowed (No Issue).\n\nHowever, in rural counties and areas with more permissive CCW (Carry Concealed Weapon) issuance policies, permits may be granted (Shall Issue), but even then, the issuing authority can impose restrictions on the permit holder, limiting concealed carry to specific purposes listed on the approved CCW permit application.\n\nImportantly, if you obtain a concealed carry permit in California, it is valid statewide, regardless of where it was issued. This means that residents from counties with more permissive policies can legally carry concealed firearms in areas with No Issue policies, like Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nCalifornia does not recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states, and non-residents generally cannot obtain a California concealed carry permit. However, there are federal laws, such as the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, which may exempt certain individuals from some of California's firearm regulations.\n\nSo, to answer the question: Yes, it is possible to carry a gun on your person in California, but it depends on where you live or where you obtained your concealed carry permit, and whether you meet the criteria set by the issuing authorities in your specific jurisdiction. The situation is complex and can vary significantly across the state.",

Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic book of the Dick Sprang era, as well as the 1960s television series. Keaton chose not to reprise the role due to failing to negotiate with studio executives Terry Semel and Bob Daly about the overall approach to the script.

Domesticated animals are known as breeds, normally bred by a professional breeder, while domesticated plants are known as varieties, cultigens, or cultivars. Two purebred animals of different breeds produce a crossbreed, and crossbred plants are called hybrids. Flowers, vegetables and fruit-trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non-commercial professionals: major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals. Question: is artificial selection and selective breeding the same thing?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nArtificial selection and selective breeding are related concepts, but they are not exactly the same thing.\n\nArtificial selection is a broader term that encompasses the intentional manipulation of the breeding process by humans to develop specific traits in animals or plants. It involves selecting organisms with desired traits and allowing them to reproduce, thereby increasing the frequency of those traits in the population over generations. This process can be applied to both animals and plants.\n\nSelective breeding, on the other hand, is a specific method within artificial selection. It refers to the deliberate breeding of organisms, typically within a single species or closely related species, to enhance or fix specific traits. Selective breeding is a subset of artificial selection that focuses on improving specific characteristics in a controlled manner.\n\nSo, while selective breeding is a form of artificial selection, artificial selection encompasses a broader range of practices that involve manipulating the genetic traits of organisms through selective reproduction.",

Even if nothing is stolen in a burglary, the act is a statutory offense. Buildings can include hangars, sheds, barns, and coops; burglary of boats, aircraft, trucks, and railway cars is possible. Burglary may be an element in crimes involving rape, arson, kidnapping, identity theft, or violation of civil rights; indeed, the ``plumbers'' of the Watergate scandal were technically burglars.

Some states may treat car burglary as a felony if it involves certain aggravating factors, such as intent to commit a serious crime, possession of burglary tools, or prior criminal convictions.

        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation: Pixel density (PPI or PPCM) and resolution are related but not the same thing.

It defines the overall clarity and level of detail an image can contain. Resolution is typically expressed as the total number of pixels, such as 1920x1080 for a Full HD display.\n\nWhile higher pixel density often correlates with higher resolution, they are not interchangeable terms.

It is an alternative to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Both modalities stent the lungs' alveoli open and thus recruit more of the lung's surface area for ventilation. But while PEEP refers to devices tvt impose positive pressure only at the end of the exhalation, CPAP devices apply continuous positive airway pressure throughout the breathing cycle. Thus, the ventilator itself does not cycle during CPAP, no additional pressure above the level of CPAP is provided, and patients must initiate all of their breaths. Question: is a cpap the same as a ventilator?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nA Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine is not the same as a ventilator. While both CPAP and ventilators provide respiratory support, they operate differently and serve different purposes.\n\nA CPAP machine delivers continuous positive airway pressure to help keep the airways open, primarily used in cases of obstructive sleep apnea. It doesn't provide additional breaths or ventilatory support. Instead, it assists individuals in breathing more easily during sleep by preventing airway collapse.\n\nIn contrast, a ventilator is a more complex device used in critical care situations to support patients who cannot breathe effectively on their own or need assistance due to severe respiratory issues. Ventilators can provide both positive pressure during inhalation and exhalation and can completely take over a patient's breathing if necessary.\n\nSo, a CPAP is not the same as a ventilator, as they have different functions and modes of operation.",

The sugar component consists of alternating residues of \u03b2-(1,4) linked N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) . Attached to the N-acetylmuramic acid is a peptide chain of three to five amino acids. The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh-like layer. Peptidoglycan serves a structural role in the bacterial cell wall, giving structural strength, as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. A common misconception is that peptidoglycan gives the cell its shape; however, whereas peptidoglycan helps maintain the structural strength of the cell, it is actually the MreB protein that facilitates cell shape. Peptidoglycan is also involved in binary fission during bacterial cell reproduction. Question: do all bacteria have peptidoglycan in their cell walls?",

The phrase ``mal de d\u00e9barquement'' is French and translates to ``illness of disembarkation''. MdDS is typically diagnosed by a neurologist or an ear nose & throat specialist when a person reports a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling (though they are not necessarily rocking). This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience. Because most vestibular testing proves to be negative, doctors may be baffled as they attempt to diagnose the syndrome. A major diagnostic indicator is that most patients feel better while driving or riding in a car, i.e.: while in passive motion. MdDS is unexplained by structural brain or inner ear pathology and most often corresponds with a motion trigger, although it can occur spontaneously. This differs from the very common condition of ``land sickness'' that most people feel for a short time after a motion event such as a boat cruise, aircraft ride, or even a treadmill routine which may only last minutes to a few hours.

While both are related to \"white cheese,\" there is a distinction between them based on French legislation. Fromage frais must contain live cultures when sold, indicating that fermentation is ongoing, whereas with fromage blanc (which is similar to quark), fermentation has been halted. Therefore, fromage frais is a type of fresh cheese that is still fermenting, while quark and fromage blanc are typically considered to be a different category of white cheese where fermentation has been stopped.",

Refugees compose about one-tenth of the total annual immigration to the United States, though some large refugee populations are very prominent. Since World War II, more refugees have found homes in the U.S. than any other nation and more than two million refugees have arrived in the U.S. since 1980. In the years 2005 through 2007, the number of asylum seekers accepted into the U.S. was about 40,000 per year. This compared with about 30,000 per year in the UK and 25,000 in Canada. The U.S. accounted for about 10% of all asylum-seeker acceptances in the OECD countries in 1998-2007. The United States is by far the most populous OECD country and receives fewer than the average number of refugees per capita: In 2010-14 (before the massive migrant surge in Europe in 2015) it ranked 28 of 43 industrialized countries reviewed by UNHCR.

During perimenopause, the menstrual cycle and the periods become irregular and eventually stop altogether, but even when periods are still regular, the egg quality of women in their forties is lower than in younger women, making the likelihood of conceiving a healthy baby also reduced, particularly after age 42.

The cartridge headspaces on the mouth of the case. It was introduced in 1908 by Colt, for use in its new Colt Model 1908 pocket hammerless semi-automatic, and has been a popular self-defense cartridge ever since, seeing wide use in numerous handguns (typically smaller weapons). Other names for .380 ACP include .380 Auto, 9mm Browning, 9mm Corto, 9mm Kurz, 9mm Short, 9\u00d717mm and 9 mm Browning Court (which is the C.I.P. designation).

However, technically, \".380 ACP\" is the correct designation for this cartridge, and it stands for \"Automatic Colt Pistol.\" On the other hand, \".380 Auto\" is a common colloquial term used to describe the same cartridge. So, while they are often used interchangeably in practice, \".380 ACP\" is the official designation, and \".380 Auto\" is a common nickname for it.\n\nIn summary, while \".380 Auto\" is often used to refer to \".380 ACP,\" they are not precisely the same in strict technical terms, but they are closely related and often used interchangeably.",

Less commonly, this solution is referred to as physiological saline or isotonic saline (because it closely approximates isotonic, that is, physiologically normal, solution); although neither of those names is technically accurate (because normal saline is not exactly like blood serum), they convey the practical effect usually seen: good fluid balance with minimal hypotonicity or hypertonicity. NS is used frequently in intravenous drips (IVs) for patients who cannot take fluids orally and have developed or are in danger of developing dehydration or hypovolemia. NS is also used for aseptic purpose. NS is typically the first fluid used when hypovolemia is severe enough to threaten the adequacy of blood circulation, and has long been believed to be the safest fluid to give quickly in large volumes. However, it is now known that rapid infusion of NS can cause metabolic acidosis. Question: is normal saline the same as 0.9 sodium chloride?",

However, it's important to note that while normal saline is a saline solution, it is not exactly the same as a 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The key distinction lies in the fact that normal saline, while similar, is not exactly like blood serum in terms of its electrolyte composition.\n\nA 0.9% sodium chloride solution is a specific concentration of sodium chloride in water, and it is isotonic, meaning it has the same osmolarity as blood serum. On the other hand, normal saline is commonly used because it closely approximates isotonic or physiologically normal solution, but it may not be an exact match in terms of electrolyte composition.

Play begins with the player on the dealer's left drawing the top card, and subsequent players taking turns in a clockwise fashion. However, the first player usually starts with a single card and doesn't have the option to pick up a card from the discard pile or stock because there is no preceding player's discard to pick up. The first player's only option is to draw a card, and the ability to pick up cards from the discard pile becomes relevant as the game progresses.",

        "question": "Passage: It is important to note that mithridatism is not effective against all types of poison (immunity generally is only possible with biologically complex types which the immune system can respond to) and, depending on the toxin, the practice can lead to the lethal accumulation of a poison in the body. Results depend on how each poison is processed by the body, ie, on how the toxic compound is metabolized or passed out of the body. In some cases, it is possible to build up tolerance against specific non-biological poisons. For some poisons, this involves conditioning the liver to produce more of the particular enzymes that deal with these poisons (for example alcohol). Another mechanism involves conditioning the target tissues of the poisons. These methods do not work for all non-biological poisons. Exposure to certain toxic substances, such as hydrofluoric acid and heavy metals, is either lethal or has little to no effect, and thus cannot be used in this way at all. Arsenic is a notable exception with some people actually having a genetic adaptation granting them higher resistance which can be replicated with mithridatism. In addition, simple toxins that work through chemical processes that bypass the immune system cannot be dealt with (good example would be the variants of cyanide). Question: can you build up an immunity to arsenic?",

The effectiveness of mithridatism depends on the specific poison, how it is processed by the body, and whether the body can develop mechanisms to counteract its effects.

        "question": "Passage: In no-limit and pot-limit games, there is a minimum amount that is required to be bet in order to open the action. In games with blinds, this amount is usually the amount of the big blind. Standard poker rules require that raises must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise. For example, if an opponent bets $5, a player must raise by at least another $5, and they may not raise by only $2. If a player raises a bet of $5 by $7 (for a total of $12), the next re-raise would have to be by at least another $7 (the previous raise) more than the $12 (for a total of at least $19). The primary purpose of the minimum raise rule is to avoid game delays caused by ``nuisance'' raises (small raises of large bets, such as an extra $1 over a current bet of $50, that have little effect on the action but take time as all others must call). This rule is overridden by table stakes rules, so that a player may in fact raise a $5 bet by $2 if that $2 is his entire remaining stake. Question: do you have to raise double in poker?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation: In standard poker rules, you do not have to raise double in order to make a valid raise. The rule is that raises must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise. For example, if your opponent bets $5, you can raise by at least another $5, and you do not need to double that amount. So, if you raise $5 to a total of $10, it is a valid raise. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that raises have a meaningful impact on the game and to avoid small, inconsequential raises that can slow down the game. However, in some specific situations, like when a player's remaining chips are less than the minimum raise amount, they can go all-in with their remaining chips, which may not double the previous bet or raise.",

A spark plug has a metal threaded shell, electrically isolated from a central electrode by a porcelain insulator. The central electrode, which may contain a resistor, is connected by a heavily insulated wire to the output terminal of an ignition coil or magneto. The spark plug's metal shell is screwed into the engine's cylinder head and thus electrically grounded. The central electrode protrudes through the porcelain insulator into the combustion chamber, forming one or more spark gaps between the inner end of the central electrode and usually one or more protuberances or structures attached to the inner end of the threaded shell and designated the side, earth, or ground electrode(s). Question: does a spark plug keep an engine running?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nA spark plug is a crucial component of a spark-ignition engine, but it doesn't keep the engine running on its own. Its primary function is to ignite the compressed fuel/air mixture within the combustion chamber by producing an electric spark. This ignition initiates the combustion process that ultimately powers the engine. However, the spark plug is just one part of the ignition system, which includes components like the ignition coil or magneto.\n\nTo keep an engine running, various other factors and components come into play, such as the continuous supply of fuel, proper air intake, and the mechanical functioning of the engine components like pistons, crankshaft, and valves.

Fixed assets are a subset of non-current assets. \n\nNon-current assets, also known as long-term assets, encompass a broader category of assets that a company holds for long-term use and not for immediate sale to customers. This includes items like land, buildings, machinery, vehicles, and even intangible assets like patents or copyrights. Non-current assets have value, but they are not intended for sale to consumers and are not easily converted to cash.\n\nFixed assets, on the other hand, are a specific subset of non-current assets. These are tangible assets that a company uses in its operations and expects to use for an extended period. In the example provided, the oven used by a baking firm, motor vehicles for deliveries, and cash registers are considered fixed assets. These are assets with a fixed, known value that depreciates over time.\n\nSo, while fixed assets are a type of non-current asset, not all non-current assets are fixed assets. Non-current assets can also include investments in other companies, long-term financial instruments, and other items that don't fall under the category of fixed assets.",

Sean has a hard time getting Alex to bring down her walls. Alex herself tries not to get emotional and Sean sometimes gets Alex to recognize that he likes her. Despite Sean giving many signs of attraction to Alex, she either ignored them or she was oblivious to them since she was emotionally not ready to commit to a relationship with all the things happening in her life. He and Alex share a first kiss in a car with Birkoff driving and Ryan in the passenger seat. In the second-season finale, he tries to ask her out on a date four times, but Alex never lets him finish due to being in action, criticizing that he said that she was a goal, Alex passing out due to a broken arm and being electrocuted, and Nikita interrupting Sean right before he was going to ask Alex while she was in a Division medical facility. At the start of season 3, it appears Alex and Sean are in a relationship. However, by episode 3 it is revealed that Sean is only at Division for Alex, because he loved her. But Alex is at Division because it is the only place she knows as home, where she can be herself, and where her ``family'' (Nikita) is. After a toxin is released in the lab, Sean returns to ask Alex why she's not returning his calls, and asks her again why she's still there. ``I can't tell you what to do, Alex, but I'm not going to stand by and watch this place destroy another person that I love,'' he says before he kisses her. ``I love you, but if that's not enough of a reason for you to leave, I've got no reason to stay.'' After he leaves, she pops a pill and heads for the operations floor, insisting that she ought to be included in the hunt for Amanda. They eventually make up after an emotional scene in a medical room, they then entered a storage closet and make love, for the first time. In ``Black Badge'', Amanda framed Sean for the death of the head of the CIA. As a result, they faked his death and Sean was officially welcomed into Division by Alex. Sean died in season 3 episode 18, as a result of a bullet nicking his artery. They shared their last moments together in where they met, operations. When Nikita enters OPS, she finds Birkoff near Sean and Alex gone. She presumably went to get revenge for the current events. Sean later died in Alex's arms towards the end of season 3.

The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol and are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as \u03b2-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth.

The focus of breaking in an engine is on the contact between the piston rings of the engine and the cylinder wall. There is no universal preparation or set of instructions for breaking in an engine. Most importantly, experts disagree on whether it is better to start engines on high or low power to break them in. While there are still consequences to an unsuccessful break-in, they are harder to quantify on modern engines than on older models. In general, people no longer break in the engines of their own vehicles after purchasing a car or motorcycle, because the process is done in production. It is still common, even today, to find that an owner's manual recommends gentle use at first (often specified as the first 500 or 1000 kilometres or miles). But it is usually only normal use without excessive demands that is specified, as opposed to light/limited use.

The rhombus is often called a diamond, after the diamonds suit in playing cards which resembles the projection of an octahedral diamond, or a lozenge, though the former sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60\u00b0 angle (see Polyiamond), and the latter sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 45\u00b0 angle.

The term \"equilateral\" is used to describe such a figure, as it means all sides have equal length. The passage also notes that a rhombus is often referred to as a \"diamond\" because it resembles the diamond shape found on playing cards. However, it does clarify that the term \"diamond\" might sometimes specifically refer to a rhombus with a 60\u00b0 angle.\n\nStep-by-step Thinking:\n1. The key question is whether a rhombus is the same as a diamond.\n2. The passage mentions that the rhombus is often called a diamond, so there's a colloquial equivalence between the two.\n3. However, the passage also specifies that sometimes the term \"diamond\" can refer specifically to a rhombus with a 60\u00b0 angle.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven the nuances in the passage, it can be deduced that while a rhombus is often referred to as a diamond, they aren't always strictly the same, especially when considering specific angular definitions. \n\nResponse: False.",

In a 3-way lamp, the ability to produce different levels of light comes from the combination of the 3-way bulb, the socket, and the 3-way switch. If you use a regular bulb, it will not utilize the multiple filaments or circuitry designed for the 3-way functionality, and you will get a single, fixed level of illumination, which is usually the highest setting.",

Question: is socialized medicine the same as universal health care?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation:\nUniversal health care and socialized medicine are related concepts, but they are not the same thing.\n\nUniversal health care refers to a healthcare system where healthcare and financial protection are provided to all citizens of a particular country. It aims to ensure that everyone in society has access to necessary healthcare services and financial protection against healthcare costs. Universal health care can be organized in various ways, and it doesn't necessarily mean that the government directly owns or operates all healthcare facilities.\n\nSocialized medicine, on the other hand, is a specific model of universal health care where the government owns and operates healthcare facilities and employs healthcare providers. In a socialized medicine system, the government is directly responsible for the provision of healthcare services, and healthcare providers are often government employees.\n\nSo, while socialized medicine is one way to achieve universal health care, universal health care can also be achieved through other means, such as a single-payer system or a mixed public-private healthcare system.

It ranks below five of a kind and above four of a kind. As part of a straight flush, an ace can rank either above a king or below a two, depending on the rules of the game. Under high rules, an ace can rank either high (e.g. A\u2665 K\u2665 Q\u2665 J\u2665 10\u2665 is an ace-high straight flush) or low (e.g. 5 4 3 2 A is a five-high straight flush), but cannot rank both high and low in the same hand (e.g. Q\u2663 K\u2663 A\u2663 2\u2663 3\u2663 is an ace-high flush, not a straight flush). Under deuce-to-seven low rules, aces can only rank high, so a hand such as 5\u2660 4\u2660 3\u2660 2\u2660 A\u2660 is actually an ace-high flush.

Demeter says the same thing, but also states that ``if these laws do not prohibit voting by proxy, the body can pass a law permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired.'' RONR opines, ``Ordinarily it should neither be allowed nor required, because proxy voting is incompatible with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which membership is individual, personal, and nontransferable.

Allegedly, Texas has this right inherently (as a former independent nation) or because it negotiated special provisions when it joined the Union (this version has been stated as fact on a PBS website). However, the legend is false. Neither the Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States nor the Ordinance of Annexation contain any provisions regarding flags. According to the United States Flag Code, any state flag can be flown at the same height as the U.S. flag, but the U.S. flag should be on its right (the viewer's left). Consistent with the U.S. Flag Code, the Texas Flag Code specifies that the state flag should either be flown below the U.S. flag if on the same pole or at the same height as the U.S. flag if on separate poles.

The Texas Flag Code also specifies that the state flag should either be flown below the U.S. flag if on the same pole or at the same height as the U.S. flag if on separate poles.

        "question": "Passage: The Federal Reserve began taking high-denomination currency out of circulation (destroying large bills received by banks) in 1969. As of May 30, 2009, only 336 $10,000 bills were known to exist; 342 remaining $5,000 bills; and 165,372 remaining $1,000 bills. Due to their rarity, collectors often pay considerably more than the face value of the bills to acquire them. Some are in museums in other parts of the world. Question: are there any thousand dollar bills in circulation?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nThe passage provides information that the Federal Reserve began taking high-denomination currency out of circulation in 1969. As of May 30, 2009, there were only 165,372 remaining $1,000 bills known to exist, but it does not specify whether these bills are still in circulation or if they are held by collectors or in museums. Given the historical context and the fact that the passage mentions collectors paying more than the face value to acquire them and some being in museums, it's highly unlikely that $1,000 bills are in regular circulation. Therefore, the answer is false.",

        "question": "Passage: Cement plaster is a mixture of suitable plaster, sand, portland cement and water which is normally applied to masonry interiors and exteriors to achieve a smooth surface. Interior surfaces sometimes receive a final layer of gypsum plaster. Walls constructed with stock bricks are normally plastered while face brick walls are not plastered. Various cement-based plasters are also used as proprietary spray fireproofing products. These usually use vermiculite as lightweight aggregate. Heavy versions of such plasters are also in use for exterior fireproofing, to protect LPG vessels, pipe bridges and vessel skirts. Question: can i mix cement and plaster of paris?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nCement plaster and plaster of Paris are not typically mixed together in construction applications. Cement plaster is a mixture of sand, Portland cement, and water used for achieving a smooth surface on masonry interiors and exteriors. Plaster of Paris, on the other hand, is a specific type of gypsum plaster used for artistic and casting purposes.\n\nThese two materials have different properties and uses. Mixing them together would not result in a suitable or effective construction material. It's important to use the appropriate material for the specific purpose you have in mind, and in this case, combining cement plaster and plaster of Paris is not recommended.",

The average reach correlates to the person's height. Age and sex have to be taken into account to best predict height from arm span. Question: is the width of your arms your height?",
        "pred_ans": "False\n\nExplanation: The passage explains that arm span or reach is the measurement of the length from one end of an individual's arms to the other when raised parallel to the ground at shoulder height at a 90\u00b0 angle. It mentions that the average reach correlates to a person's height, but it also notes that age and sex must be taken into account to best predict height from arm span. This implies that while arm span can be related to height, it is not necessarily equivalent to a person's height, as other factors like age and sex can influence this relationship. Therefore, the statement that \"the width of your arms is your height\" is not accurate, making the answer \"False.\"",
