previous demo: Q: A salesman bought a case of 48 backpacks for $576. He sold 17 of them for $18 at the swap meet, 10 were sold to a department store for $25 each. If the remainder were sold for $22 each. How much was the salesman's profit?
A: The salesman sold 17 bags for 17 bags x $18/bag = $306. He sold 10 more for 10 bags x $25/bag = $250. Thus far he has sold 17 bags + 10 bags = 27 bags. Therefore he sold 48 bags - 27 bags = 21 bags for $22 each. 21 bags were sold for 21 bags x $22/bag = $462. In total the salesman made $306 + $250 + $462 = $1018. The salesman made $1018 - $576 = $442 in profit. Therefore the answer is 442.
Q: Ursula earns $8.50 an hour working in a restaurant. She works 8 hours a day. If she works 20 days a month, determine her annual salary.
A: Ursula earns 8 x $8.50 = $68 a day. In a month, she earns 20 x $68 = $1360. Therefore, Ursula's annual salary is 12 x $1360 = $16,320. Therefore the answer is 16320.
Q: The selling price of a bicycle that had sold for $220 last year was increased by 15%. What is the new price?
A: The price of the bicycle increased by $220 * 15/100 = $33. Adding the increment price, the new price is $220 + $33 = $253. Therefore the answer is 253.
Q: There are 12 inches to a foot. Blossom measures her room and finds that it is exactly 10 feet long in each direction. In square inches, what is the area of her room?
A: First translate the feet to inches or 10 feet * 12 inches per foot = 120 inches. Then use length * width which is 120 * 120 = 14400 square inches. Therefore the answer is 14400.
Q: Ruiz receives a monthly salary of $500. If he received a 6% raise, how much will be Ruiz's new salary?
A: Ruiz has $500 x 6/100 = $30 salary raise. Thus, his new salary is $500 + $30 = $530. Therefore the answer is 530.
Q: A store sold a certain brand of jeans for $40. They only have few pairs of jeans left so they decided to give 10% discount on every two pairs of jeans bought by a customer at any one time. How much will a customer pay for 3 pairs of jeans?
A: Two pairs of jeans cost $40 x 2 = $80. A discount of $80 x 10/100 = $8 will be given for this. Hence, the cost of two pairs of jeans will now be $80 - $8 = $72. Therefore, the customer will pay $72 + $40 = $112 for the three pairs of jeans. Therefore the answer is 112.
Q: A retail store wants to hire 50 new phone reps to assist with the increased call volume that they will experience over the holiday.  Each phone rep will work 8 hours a day and will be paid $14.00 an hour.  After 5 days, how much will the company pay all 50 new employees?
A: There are 50 reps and they will work 8 hour days so that's 50*8 = 400 hours. They will work 5 days a week so that's 5*400 = 2,000 hours. Each worker will be paid $14.00 an hour and in 5 days they will have worked 2,000 hours so that's 14*2000 = $28,000. Therefore the answer is 28000.
Q: In a factory, there are 300 employees. 200 of them earn $12 per hour. Of the rest, 40 of them earn $14 per hour. All others earn $17 per hour. What is the cost to employ all these people for one 8-hour long shift?
A: The cost of the 200 employees is 200 employees * $12/employee/hour = $2400 per hour. The cost of the 40 employees is 40 employees * $14/employee/hour = $560 per hour. The rest means 300 employees - 200 employees - 40 employees = 60 employees. These 60 employees' employment costs are at 60 employees * $17/employee/hour = $1020 per hour. So in total all employees earn $2400/hour + $560/hour + $1020/hour = $3980/hour. During an 8-hour shift, this cost would be at 8 hours * $3980/hour = $31840. Therefore the answer is 31840.

Judgement is: Yes.

Reason: The distilled versions of the demonstrations contain all the essential information required to solve each problem, and they also include the necessary calculation steps to arrive at the final answers. While some explanations have been shortened, the core content and logic are still present, ensuring that the solutions are complete and accurate.

prediction is: Given information:
- Ratio of electric poles to electric wires: 1:3
- Total number of electric wires: 45

Let's break down the ratio. If the ratio is 1:3, it means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Now, since we know there are 45 electric wires, we can calculate the number of electric poles needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as "P" and the number of electric wires as "W".

We have the equation:
Wires per Pole = Total Wires / Total Poles

Substitute the values:
3 = 45 / P

Now solve for P:
P = 45 / 3
P = 15

Therefore the answer is: 15 electric poles.

Judgement is: Yes

Reason:
The distilled version of the demonstrations contains all the necessary information for solving each problem and includes all the essential calculation steps required to arrive at the final answer. It maintains the core content and logical flow while simplifying and condensing the explanations.

prediction is: Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Let's assume the number of electric poles is "x".
According to the ratio, the number of electric wires is 3 times the number of electric poles, which means the number of electric wires is 3x.

Given that the total number of electric wires is 45:
3x = 45

Now, solve for x:
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore the answer is:
The electric company needs a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

Judgement is: Yes

Reasons:
1. The distilled versions of the questions still contain all the essential information needed to solve the problems. They include the given values, relevant quantities, and essential conditions from the original questions.
2. The distilled answers include all the necessary calculation steps to arrive at the final answers. They perform the required calculations and provide the steps necessary to reach the solutions, similar to the original answers.

prediction is: Given information:
- Ratio of electric poles to electric wires: 1:3
- Total number of electric wires needed: 45

Let's denote the number of electric poles as "P" and the number of electric wires as "W".

We are given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, which means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Using this ratio, we can set up an equation:
P / W = 1 / 3

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45:
W = 45

Now we can solve for the number of electric poles (P):
P = (1 / 3) * W
P = (1 / 3) * 45
P = 15

Therefore the answer is: 15 electric poles.

Reasoning: The distilled versions of the problems retain all the necessary information and calculation steps required to arrive at the final answers. The key details, formulas, and calculations are still present, making the solutions clear and concise.

prediction is: Sure, let's go through each of the examples step by step:

Q1: Given that there are 48 backpacks sold for $576 and the sales amount is $1018, you can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost from the sales: $1018 - $576 = $442.

Q2: Ursula earns $8.50 per hour, works 8 hours a day, and works 20 days per month. To calculate her annual earnings, you can multiply these values: $8.50/hr * 8 hrs/day * 20 days/month * 12 months = $16,320.

Q3: A bicycle's original price is $220, and it increases by 15%. To find the new price, you can calculate the increase and add it to the original price: $220 + 0.15 * $220 = $253.

Q4: If Blossom's room has dimensions 10ft x 10ft, the area in square feet is 10ft * 10ft = 100 sq. ft. To convert this to square inches, you multiply by the conversion factor (1 sq. ft = 144 sq. inches): 100 sq. ft * 144 sq. inches/sq. ft = 14400 sq. inches.

Q5: Ruiz's salary is $500 and he gets a 6% raise. To calculate the raise amount, you multiply the current salary by the raise percentage: 0.06 * $500 = $30. The new salary is the current salary plus the raise: $500 + $30 = $530.

Q6: Jeans cost $40 each, and there's a 10% discount for buying 2 pairs. To calculate the cost for 3 pairs, you apply the discount to 2 pairs and then add the cost of the third pair: 2 pairs * $40 * (1 - 0.10) + 1 pair * $40 = $72 + $40 = $112.

Q7: The store has 50 representatives who earn $14 per hour. They work 8 hours a day for 5 days. To calculate the total cost, you can multiply the hourly wage by the hours worked by each representative and then multiply by the number of days: $14/hr * 8 hrs/day * 5 days * 50 reps = $28,000.

Q8: In the factory, there are 200 employees earning $12 per hour, 40 employees earning $14 per hour, and the rest earning $17 per hour. For an 8-hour shift, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying each group's wage by the number of employees in that group and then summing them up: (200 employees * $12/hr + 40 employees * $14/hr + remaining employees * $17/hr) * 8 hrs = $31840.

Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires in the neighborhood is 1:3 and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, you can calculate the number of electric poles by dividing the total number of electric wires by the ratio: 45 / 3 = 15.

Therefore the answer is: **15** electric poles.

Judgement is: Yes

Reason:
The distilled version of the demonstrations contains all the essential information needed to solve each problem and includes the key calculation steps required to arrive at the final answers. The information has been condensed and summarized effectively while retaining the core elements necessary for solving the problems.

prediction is: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with these calculations step by step. Let's go through each question:

Q1:
Given:
Bpks (Bottles): 48
Price per Bottle: $576
Total Sales: $1018

To find the Profit, we subtract the Total Sales from the Cost:
Profit = Total Sales - Total Cost
Profit = $1018 - $576
Profit = $442

Q2:
Given:
Urs's Hourly Rate: $8.50
Hours per Day: 8
Days per Month: 20

To find Ann's earnings, we calculate Urs's monthly earnings and then multiply by 12:
Urs's Monthly Earnings = Urs's Hourly Rate * Hours per Day * Days per Month
Urs's Monthly Earnings = $8.50 * 8 * 20 = $1360

Ann's Annual Earnings = Urs's Monthly Earnings * 12
Ann's Annual Earnings = $1360 * 12 = $16,320

Q3:
Given:
Initial Bike Price: $220
Percentage Increase: 15%

To find the New Bike Price, we add the percentage increase to the initial price:
Percentage Increase Amount = Initial Bike Price * (Percentage Increase / 100)
Percentage Increase Amount = $220 * (15 / 100) = $33

New Bike Price = Initial Bike Price + Percentage Increase Amount
New Bike Price = $220 + $33 = $253

Q4:
Given:
Room Dimensions: 10ft x 10ft
Area in square inches = 14400 sq. in.

To find the area in square feet, we divide the given area in square inches by 144:
Area in square feet = Area in square inches / 144
Area in square feet = 14400 / 144 = 100 sq. ft.

Q5:
Given:
Ruiz's Salary: $500
Percentage Increase: 6%

To find the New Salary, we add the percentage increase to the initial salary:
Percentage Increase Amount = Ruiz's Salary * (Percentage Increase / 100)
Percentage Increase Amount = $500 * (6 / 100) = $30

New Salary = Ruiz's Salary + Percentage Increase Amount
New Salary = $500 + $30 = $530

Q6:
Given:
Jeans Price per Pair: $40
Discount: 10% off for 2 pairs
Cost for 3 Pairs: $112

To find the Discounted Price for 2 pairs, we calculate the discounted amount and then subtract it from the total cost:
Discount Amount for 2 Pairs = Jeans Price per Pair * 2 * (Discount / 100)
Discount Amount for 2 Pairs = $40 * 2 * (10 / 100) = $8

Total Cost for 3 Pairs = Discounted Price for 2 Pairs + Regular Price for 1 Pair
$112 = $40 - $8 + 1 * Regular Price
Regular Price = $80

Q7:
Given:
Number of Reps: 50
Hourly Wage: $14
Hours per Day: 8
Days per Week: 5
Total Cost: $28,000

To find the total monthly cost, we calculate the weekly cost and then multiply by 4 (assuming 4 weeks in a month):
Weekly Cost = Number of Reps * Hourly Wage * Hours per Day * Days per Week
Weekly Cost = 50 * $14 * 8 * 5 = $28,000

Monthly Cost = Weekly Cost * 4 = $28,000 * 4 = $112,000

Q8:
Given:
Number of Employees (200 employees at $12/hr, 40 employees at $14/hr, rest at $17/hr)
Cost for 8-hour Shift: $31,840

To find the average hourly wage, we calculate the weighted average of the different wage rates:
Average Hourly Wage = (Total Cost / Total Employee Hours)
Total Employee Hours = (200 * 8) + (40 * 8) + (Remaining Employees * 8)

Using the given total cost and average hourly wage, we can solve for the total number of employee hours.

Now, moving on to the final question:

Given:
Ratio of Electric Poles to Electric Wires: 1:3
Total Number of Electric Wires: 45

Let's set up a proportion to solve for the number of electric poles:
1 / 3 = X / 45

Cross-multiplying:
3X = 1 * 45
X = 45 / 3
X = 15

Therefore the answer is: 15.

Extracted answer: 15
