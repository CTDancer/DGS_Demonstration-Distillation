question is: Passage: "During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it. A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle. Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages.

question is: Passage: "While the Base Ball writers of the cities which comprise the Southern Association have no organized membership similar to the Base Ball Writers' Association of the major leagues and the organizations which are best known as the class AA leagues, they are a clever, hard-working group of young men, who have labored in season and out of season, not only to build up Base Ball but to build it up on the right lines.  Experience of more than a quarter of a century has most abundantly proved that the standard of Base Ball has steadily been elevated.  It needs no compilation of fact nor any dogmatic assertion on the part of the Editor of the GUIDE to attest that fact.  It is a present condition which speaks for itself.  The general tone of the players is far higher than it was and there has come into evidence a marked improvement in the spirit of the men who own Base Ball clubs.  In the earlier history of the sport there was a tendency to win by any means that did not actually cross the line of dishonesty.  Later there came a season when the commercial end of the game tended to encroach upon the limits of the pastime.  This has been repressed in the last two seasons and to-day the morale of Base Ball is of a higher type than it ever has been in the history of the pastime. "

Question2: "What characteristics of the pastime of baseball has been repressed?"Choices: A. When commercial end of the game encroached on limits of pastime B. They are a clever and hard-working C. Labored in season and out of season D. Baseball feelings E. The Base Ball writers of the cities have no organized membership F. The tendency for the commercial end of the game, and for more dishonesty to encroach upon the pastime in general G. When baseball was fun 
Question3: "Has repression of the tendency to win by any means raised or lowered the morale of Base Ball?"Choices: A. Lowered B. Raised 
Question4: "Which sport had a tendency to win by any means, which was later repressed?"Choices: A. The commercial end of the game B. Baseball C. Southern Association D. The pastime E. Just do not cheat F. Basketball

question is: Passage: "This week, we've been treated to the increasingly familiar sight of former NBA star and provocateur Dennis Rodman attending events in Pyongyang, North Korea. It's his fourth trip in less than 12 months. On Tuesday, an angry Rodman defended his visit in a CNN interview straight from Pyongyang, at one point saying to "New Day" anchor Chris Cuomo, "I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think ..." in response to question about Kenneth Bae, an American detained in North Korea. When will we tire of this circus? In case you don't watch cable news, you might miss that the media really loves this kind of thing. No story about North Korea is too weird to go unreported, even if there is no real information to disseminate. Recall the recent rumor that Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being fed to hungry dogs, which most likely was started as satire on Chinese social media but was at first reported widely in the media (CNN was unable to confirm and did not report the story). In media discourse, North Korea is the classic enemy. The regime's injustices, quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans that their own country is just the opposite: Normal, well-functioning, a land of peace and liberty. But add in Rodman to the North Korea story, and it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover. Rodman himself seems to be thriving on finding a strange smidgen of relevance through his visits to North Korea (and perhaps a Paddy Power paycheck). Though often described as quite shy, he has always enjoyed challenging the values of Middle America. North Korea is providing him a new avenue to be in the spotlight. The most passive player in this tragicomedy is Rodman's home country, the United States. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of "this has nothing to do with us" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trip. Last winter,the State Department criticized Rodman's timing as it followed a nuclear test and rocket launch. "
Question0: "Why is Rodman so popular in the news?"Choices: A. North Korea is fascinated by his hair B. North Korea's young people love basketball C. There is little other news to cover D. The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover E. He creates the type of circus that the media loves with his speech F. Nuclear test and rocket launch G. Rodman challenges traditional values and North Korea draws media attention H. Paddy Power paycheck 
Question1: "What makes the story of Rodman in North Korea notable?"Choices: A. An American detained in North Korea B. Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country C. He Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover D. A representative of liberty where there is none E. Because North Korea is the U.S.'s classic enemy and when you add in Rodman to the North Korea story, it's bound to produce eye-popping headlines: The Weird American Athlete Goes to Weird Country story is just too easy not to cover F. Media is faking to loves this kind of thing G. His odd hair color attracts attention H. The younger generation loves basketball in North Korea 
Question2: "Dennis Roman, whom has made four trips in the last 12 months, has recently attended events in which city in North Korea?"Choices: A. Chinese B. Soule, Pyungala, Siagon C. Pyongyang D. American E. Weird Country

He has poorly represented us C. Criticized timing D. Smidgen of relevance E. Enjoys challenging values F. We are delighted to see him represent us G. Rhetorical equivalent of a dance at the prom H. They act embarrassed and indicate they have nothing to do with him I. It is unconscionable that he is supporting this country's tourism 
Question4: "Why is the US considered a passive player in the story of Rodman and North Korea?"Choices: A. Bound to produce eye-popping headlines B. They have said nothing C.

The state department declared it has nothing to do with the US F. The U.S. State Department has deployed the rhetorical equivalent of an embarrassed teenager whose dad has shown up to dance at his prom. Something along the lines of "this has nothing to do with us" is what the State Department has said with every one of Rodman's trips G. They have failed to criticism him H. Quirks and dysfunctions are reassuring to Americans 
Question5: "How has the media shown North Korea as the classic enemy?"Choices: A. By showing it's killing of the leader's uncle B.

question is: Passage: " Heavy wooden shutters dulled the noise of the boisterous gale outside.  A thick red curtain hung over the door, and a cheery log fire burnt in the stove.  A man and woman sat over it; the man, a tall, repulsive-looking creature, with unkempt hair and matted beard, his age apparently about fifty.  The woman looked seventy or more.  She too had once been tall, but now old age gave her a withered, witch-like appearance, in spite of her great height.  She was dressed in limp, faded garments, with a tattered shawl crossed over her chest, and had a scared, miserable look in her bleared old eyes.  There were a few words of explanation from the man who had come home, and then, in gruff but not unkindly tones, he bade Babette be seated, and told his mother to get some supper speedily.  She spread a coarse cloth on the wooden table, and when all was ready, lifted a large black saucepan from the stove and turned out a smoking, savoury-looking stew.  The youngest son produced a bottle containing the thin acid wine of the country, and another of spirits.  As he set them on the table, Babette noticed that across one of his hands, which were much smaller and whiter than those of his brothers, there ran a dull red scar that looked as if he had had a bad cut there.

question is: Passage: "New Horizons: Exhausted after the Civil War, Spain remained on the sidelines during World War II and began to recover economically under the oppressive, law-and-order regime of Franco. There had been a foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the 1920s, but it was the late 1950s when the rest of Europe began sun-seeking pilgrimages to Spain. Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the Spanish economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the country poured its soul into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after so many years closed off from the rest of Europe, of equal significance was the injection of foreign influences into Franco's once hermetically sealed Spain. Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in tourism; by the 1970s, the Balearics were one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in 1975. To the dismay of Franco diehards, the king brilliantly managed the transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After many years of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish regions, including the Balearics, and their languages and cultures enjoyed a long-desired renaissance. More a part of Europe than ever before, Spain joined the European Community (now European Union) in 1986, giving further boost to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain, a realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging long-term consequences also began to grow. By the late 1990s, a new emphasis on quality and, especially in the Balearics, on safeguarding the environment had finally taken root—too late for many environmentalists, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares.

question is: Passage: "Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy. It occurs between objects or substances that are touching. Thermal conductors are materials that are good conductors of heat. Thermal insulators are materials that are poor conductors of heat. Both conductors and insulators have important uses. Convection is the transfer of thermal energy. This occurs as particles move within a fluid. The fluid may be a liquid or a gas. The particles within the fluid transfer energy by moving from warmer to cooler areas. They move in loops. These loops are called convection currents. Radiation is the transfer of thermal energy by waves. These waves can travel through empty space.

question is: Passage: "After what seemed an eternity to Tibo, they arrived at the mouth of a cave between two rocky hills. The opening was low and narrow. A few saplings bound together with strips of rawhide closed it against stray beasts. Bukawai removed the primitive door and pushed Tibo within. The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to view in the blackness of the interior. Bukawai replaced the saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a narrow, rocky passage. The floor was comparatively smooth, for the dirt which lay thick upon it had been trodden and tramped by many feet until few inequalities remained. The passage was tortuous, and as it was very dark and the walls rough and rocky, Tibo was scratched and bruised from the many bumps he received. Bukawai walked as rapidly through the winding gallery as one would traverse a familiar lane by daylight. He knew every twist and turn as a mother knows the face of her child, and he seemed to be in a hurry. He jerked poor little Tibo possibly a trifle more ruthlessly than necessary even at the pace Bukawai set; but the old witch-doctor, an outcast from the society of man, diseased, shunned, hated, feared, was far from possessing an angelic temper. Nature had given him few of the kindlier characteristics of man, and these few Fate had eradicated entirely. Shrewd, cunning, cruel, vindictive, was Bukawai, the witch-doctor. "

question is: Passage: "(CNN) -- German art collector Cornelius Gurlitt, whose nearly priceless collection was confiscated because it was suspected to contain pieces looted by the Nazis, died Tuesday and left the masterpieces to a Swiss museum. One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it "his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir." The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases. The court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case. "

question is: Passage: "The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated "intelligence community" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs.

"I'm no saint," the 80-year-old Tallahasseean said. "I'm just a country lawyer." His assistant, attorney Twyla Sketchley, sat behind his shoulder and silently mouthed, "He is a saint."

question is: Passage: "Mr. Andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs. "You sit there," he commanded, "it's reserved for members of the bar, but it's all right. You're with ME."

Then even Andrews abandoned him. "The judge'll be here in a minute, now," said the assistant district attorney, and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the judge's bench. There he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of Mr. Andrews. Seated on the rail, with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to Mr. Thorndike, they laughed and talked together. The subject of their discourse was one Mike Donlin, as he appeared in vaudeville. To Mr. Thorndike it was evident that young Andrews had entirely forgotten him. He arose, and touched his sleeve. With infinite sarcasm Mr. Thorndike began: "My engagements are not pressing, but—" A court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail. "Sit down!" whispered Andrews. "The judge is coming."

question is: Passage: "Hotel California Fact: Sound is a vibration. Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium. So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, I heard nothing. After the first whoosh of the air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder. Eyes bulging in panic, but no screams. Quiet and peaceful, right? Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave. I swore, if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again, giving the camera a cheesy thumbs-up from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches, I'd kiss a monkey. Metaphorically, of course. Fact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live. This is more than the person would have sans space suit. Me, I found a space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has followed suit (pun intended), would manage to repair our ship before the less-than-twenty-four hours are up; yes, studies have been done. So, twenty-four hours. Give or take. About the time I was composing my last words in my head, trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like, that's when I heard a bell. "

Question1: "Was the air really sucked out of the shuttle?"Choices: A. No, it was sucked away from the narrator's space suit B. Yes, because the shuttle malfunctioned C. No, there was just a lighting and a thunder D. No, because the narrator heard a bell at the end 
Question2: "Why couldn't the protagonist hear anything?"Choices: A. Because the air was sucked away from the shuttle B. Because the shuttle's air that served as a medium for sound had been let out C. Because he was momentarily death from a thunder D. Because he was deaf-mute 
Question3: "What happened to the protagonist after the air was let out"Choices: A. He saved his life with his space suit and reflected on his low chances of survival after 24 hours B. He found a space suit and saved his life so far C. He was sucked away from the shuttle through a hole in the hull D. He managed to save Jesse's life E. Their eyes bulged in panic and they couldn't hear 
Question4: "Why could the narrator not hear any screams?"Choices: A. Because the air was sucked away from the shuttle B. The air has been sucked out of the shuttle, so sound cannot travel C. Because he was in an isolated capsule D. Because his communication system was down 
Question5: "Would the protagonist actually kiss a monkey?"Choices: A. Only if he ever had to see another photo of his crewmate and just metaphorically B. Only metaphorically C. Only if this would save him from death in space D. No E. Yes

question is: Passage: "Gravity is a force, but not like other forces you may know. Gravity is a bit special. You know that a force is a push or pull. If you push a ball, it starts to roll.

question is: Passage: "In many parts of the world, trees lose their leaves in autumn. The leaves turn color. Then fall from the trees to the ground. As the leaves are falling, they have kinetic energy. While they are still attached to the trees they also have energy. When they are attached they are not in motion, so how can they have energy? Instead of kinetic energy, they have stored energy. This stored energy is called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position. For example, leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall. They fall because of the pull of gravity. Potential energy can be transferred into motion. Motion can also be turned back into potential energy. Objects have potential energy due to their position. A leaf on a tree branch has potential energy. The leafs energy can be turned into motion as it falls. Once the leaf is on the ground, it has no more potential unless it is lifted back up. "
Question0: "What happens to a leaf as it falls?"Choices: A. They get energy B. They turn colors C. Leaf's energy is turned into motion D. They give off motion energy E. They gain kinetic energy F. Potential energy is turned into kinetic energy 
Question1: "What happens to leaves in autumn in many parts of the world?"Choices: A. They hibernate B. They turn color and fall C. Leaves turn color and then fall to the ground D. They grow more E. They gain kinetic energy F. They die G. They change color and fall from the trees 
Question2: "What is an example of potential energy?"Choices: A. Leaves falling B. Leaves on trees have potential energy because they can fall from gravity C. Motion D. Conduction E. Gravity F. Leaves attached to a tree G. Leaves before leaves fall to the ground 
Question3: "How does potential energy exist and change?"Choices: A. Potential energy exists of leaves and it changes because of autumn B. Through kinetic energy C. Through gravity D. Potential energy is caused by an object's position and it changes into motion E. Potential energy can exist because something is going to fall and it changes because of motion F. Through conduction G. Through nuclear energy 
Question4: "What kind of energy do leaves have while still on the trees?"Choices: A. kinetic energy B. Falling energy C. Solar energy D. Futuristic kind of energy E. Stored energy F. Potential energy G. Motion energy 
Question5: "What happens to trees in autumn?"Choices: A. They go dormant B. They hibernate C. They are in motion D. They lose their leaves E. Trees lose their leaves and their leaves change color F. They gain kinetic energy G. They lose leaves

Question0: CF
Question1: C
Question2: B
Question3: D
Question4: F
Question5: EFG

Explanation:

Question0: As a leaf falls, its potential energy is indeed turned into kinetic energy (motion). So, option C is correct. Option F is also correct because it explains the conversion from potential energy to kinetic energy.

Question1: In many parts of the world, leaves turn color and then fall to the ground in autumn, as mentioned in the passage. Therefore, options B and C are correct.

Question2: An example of potential energy is when leaves are on trees because they have the potential to fall due to gravity. This is described in the passage. So, options B and G are correct.

Question3: Potential energy exists because of an object's position, and it can change into motion. This concept is explained in the passage. So, options B and D are correct.

Question4: Leaves on trees have potential energy while still attached to the trees, as explained in the passage. Therefore, option F (potential energy) is the correct answer.

Question5: In autumn, trees lose their leaves, and the leaves change color, as mentioned in the passage. Therefore, options E, F, and G are correct.

question is: Passage: "The Romans: Legend says Rome was founded by Romulus, sired with twin brother Remus by Mars of a Vestal Virgin and abandoned on the Palatine Hill to be suckled by a she-wolf. Historians agree with the mythmakers that the site and traditional founding date of 753 b.c. are just about right. Under Etruscan domination, Rome had been a monarchy until a revolt in 510 b.c. established a patrician republic, which lasted five centuries. In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal rivalries and unstable government, Rome drew strength from a solid aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious. Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of 390 b.c. , the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this day: Via Appia, Flaminia, Aurelia. All roads did indeed lead to — and from — Rome. By 250 b.c. , the city's population had grown to an impressive 100,000. Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage (now Tunisia) and conquests in Macedonia, Asia Minor, Spain, and southern France. The rest of Italy participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor involvement in commerce and colonization. Resentment surfaced when former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua, Syracuse, and Taranto supported Hannibal's invasion in 218 b.c. Rome followed up defeat of the Carthaginians with large-scale massacres and enslavement of their Italian supporters.

question is: Passage: "Mary, Queen of Scots: The baby was Mary Stuart, who at the age of nine months was crowned Queen of Scots at the Chapel Royal, Stirling. When the news reached London, Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward. The Scots refused, and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the "Rough Wooing. " The English king ordered his general to "burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots. " But more was at stake than simply Scotland's independence: there was now a religious schism within Britain. In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control. England was thus now a Protestant country, caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen. The Scots themselves were divided, many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic. However, fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old Ailies in France, and the young queen married the Dauphin François, son of the French king. François II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after. In 1561 the 18-year-old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation, as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope. Her Protestant cousin, Elizabeth Tudor, was on the English throne, but Elizabeth — the "Virgin Queen" — had no heir. Mary was next in line for the English crown, and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions. The six years of Mary's reign were turbulent ones. She clashed early on with Edinburgh's famous Protestant reformer, John Knox, who held sway in St. Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance. In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry, Lord Darnley, much to the chagrin of Elizabeth (Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne). On 19 June 1566, in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to a son, Prince James.

question is: Passage: "FEMA inspectors were in Kerrville again Wednesday, inspecting some damaged homes. According to Lindsay, FEMA has already received 44,000 inspection requests in Texas. The number of individuals seeking relief from the floods across South Texas increased by more than 1,000 Tuesday, bringing the total to 5,855, he said. FEMA has already distributed $1.8 million in relief in the form of emergency housing. "The registration process is going rapidly," Lindsay said, adding that most registrations took between 5 and 7 minutes. Aid also is available from the local chapter of the Red Cross, but flooding victims must interview with the Red Cross separately to receive aid from them, too. Daletta Andreas, Hill Country chapter executive director, said the chapter has received calls from people who thought registering with FEMA or for cleanup services from local groups automatically registered them for Red Cross services. That's incorrect, Andreas said. "They need to come in and go through our interview process," she said. The Red Cross service center, 333 Earl Garrett St., is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily, and will be open this weekend, Andreas said. People seeking assistance must provide identification proving they reside in the area. Members of the State Bar of Texas are offering free legal advice for flood victims. Victims in Texas counties declared a federal disaster can call (800) 504-7030 for assistance with basic legal questions. The free legal assistance hotline, operated in coordination with Texas Rural Legal Aid and volunteer lawyers from across the state, will be available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. "

question is: Passage: "Crew members ran for their lives when overhanging metalwork crashed onto a stage in a Toronto park Saturday afternoon, pinning and killing one man, authorities said. The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. "Unfortunately, four people were hurt," Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. "The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area." Firefighters arrived to find one man "trapped under the structure," said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an "unstable structure," Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, "immediately rendered aid," according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said.

In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.

question is: Passage: "If there were any words capable of conveying horror to the mind of the old banker, they were convents, priests, and papacy,--of which the lawyer was well aware when speaking thus of his sister. Mrs. Bolton was certainly not addicted to papistical observances, nor was she at all likely to recommend the seclusion of her daughter in a convent. All her religious doctrines were those of the Low Church. But she had a tendency to arrive at similar results by other means. She was so afraid of the world, the flesh, and the devil, that she would fain shut up her child so as to keep her from the reach of all evil. Vowed celibacy was abominable to her, because it was the resource of the Roman Catholics; and because she had been taught to believe that convent-walls were screens for hiding unheard-of wickedness. But yet, on behalf of her child, she desired seclusion from the world, fancying that so and so only might security be ensured. Superstition was as strong with her as with any self-flagellated nun. Fasting, under that name, she held in abhorrence. But all sensual gratifications were wicked in her sight. She would allow all home indulgences to her daughter, each under some separate plea,--constrained to do so by excessive love; but she did so always in fear and trembling, lest she was giving some foothold to Satan. All of which Robert Bolton understood better even than did his father when he gave the above advice in reference to this lover. "
Question0: "Whose religious doctrines were those of the Low Church?"Choices: A. Mrs Bolton B. Robert Bolton C. Mrs. Bolton's Daughter D. Mrs. Bolton 
Question1: "Who was afraid of the world?"Choices: A. Mrs. Bolton's Daughter B. Mrs. Bolton C. Her daughter D. Robert Bolton E. Mrs Bolton 
Question2: "Who was as superstitious as any self-flagellated nun?"Choices: A. Mrs Bolton B. Robert Bolton C. Mrs. Bolton's Daughter D. Mrs. Bolton 


prediction is: Let's analyze the passage and answer the questions:

**Question 0:** "Whose religious doctrines were those of the Low Church?"

In the passage, it is stated that "All her religious doctrines were those of the Low Church." Here, "her" refers to Mrs. Bolton. So, the correct answer is **A. Mrs. Bolton**.

**Question 1:** "Who was afraid of the world?"

In the passage, it mentions that "She was so afraid of the world, the flesh, and the devil." Here, "She" refers to Mrs. Bolton. So, the correct answer is **B. Mrs. Bolton**.

**Question 2:** "Who was as superstitious as any self-flagellated nun?"

In the passage, it is mentioned that "Superstition was as strong with her as with any self-flagellated nun." Again, "her" refers to Mrs. Bolton. So, the correct answer is **A. Mrs. Bolton**.

So, the answers to the questions are as follows:

question is: Passage: "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British filmmaker, screenwriter and playwright, Mike Leigh has been in the movie business for over 35 years. Leigh on screenwriting: "I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process."

Mike Leigh: I am a filmmaker who is both a writer and director and I have this way of making films where the writing and the actors and the shooting is all combined together. I don't make a conventional screenplay ... it's a whole organic process. TSR: What do you think other scriptwriters can learn from you? ML: I think screenwriters who, because of the politics and economics of the film industry, are forced to work in a much more conventional way, are always fascinated to discuss with me how I work.

He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian King and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties. In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.

question is: Passage: "Before 9/11, the CIA did not invest in developing a robust capability to conduct paramilitary operations with U.S. personnel. It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory. Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity. The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common. The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work. The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:"One fight, one team." Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work. The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today. "

CIA is known for agility and the military is known to be methodical and cumbersome D. CIA's secretiveness and military's expensiveness 
Question3: "When did the United States concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities as a joint CIA-military team?"Choices: A. 11 B. Before 9 C. After war on Iraq D. Post-9/11 
Question4: "The CIA is stereotyped for having what kind of reputation in operations?"Choices: A. Methodical and cumbersome B. Secretive and redundant C. Agility/Agile 
Question5: "What did the CIA rely on before 9/11 to work with US personnel?"Choices: A. Military's training, exercises and planning B. Proxies organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training C. CIA-military joint teams D. They relied on proxies made by CIA operatives that had no military training 
Question6: "What was unsatisfactory without requisite military training?"Choices: A. 11 relying on proxies instead of training U.S. personnel for paramilitary operations B. Training C. CIA's relying on proxies to conduct paramilitary operations D. The result E. Cbi operatives F. War on Afghanistan G. The CIA-military join teams cooperation H. Military

question is: Passage: "For most lawyers, full waiting rooms and appointments booked out to mid-July would equate to a lucrative law practice. But Frank Smith drives a 6-year-old car with 140,000 miles on it, and paying his senior paralegal minimum wage the last few months has put him in the red. Hoped-for federal grants haven"t come through, so he"s had to raise his rates.

question is: Passage: "Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed. Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was "toi kratistoi"--"to the strongest". Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between "The Successors" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: Ptolemaic Egypt, Selucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered. "

question is: Passage: "The judge leaned back in his chair and beckoned to Mr. Andrews. It was finished. Spear was free, and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving toward the door. Their numbers showed that the friends of the young man had been many. Mr. Thorndike felt a certain twinge of disappointment. Even though the result relieved and pleased him, he wished, in bringing it about, he had had some part. He begrudged to Isaacs & Sons the credit of having given Spear his liberty. His morning had been wasted. He had neglected his own interests, and in no way assisted those of Spear. He was moving out of the railed enclosure when Andrews called him by name. "His honor," he said impressively, "wishes to speak to you." The judge leaned over his desk and shook Mr. Thorndike by the hand. Then he made a speech. The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to the neglect of their own interests, came to assist the ends of justice, and fellow-creatures in misfortune. He purposely spoke in a loud voice, and every one stopped to listen. "The law, Mr. Thorndike, is not vindictive," he said. "It wishes only to be just. Nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social influences. But when there is good in a man, I, personally, want to know it, and when gentlemen like yourself, of your standing in this city, come here to speak a good word for a man, we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen. I thank you for coming, and I wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and public-spirited." It was all quite absurd and most embarrassing, but inwardly Mr. Thorndike glowed with pleasure.

question is: Passage: "On December 4, as news came in about the discoveries in Jordan, National Security Council (NSC) Counterterrorism Coordinator Richard Clarke wrote Berger, "If George's [Tenet's] story about a planned series of UBL attacks at the Millennium is true, we will need to make some decisions NOW." He told us he held several conversations with President Clinton during the crisis. He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the event of any attacks on U.S. interests, anywhere, by  Bin Laden. He further proposed to Berger that a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan-a proposal not adopted. Warned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the millennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 and decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda plots. Michael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they would be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks." Mike was not diplomatic," Clarke reported to Berger. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan. 13 General Anthony Zinni, the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask General Musharraf to "take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest possible time." But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, Musharraf was "unwilling to take the political heat at home." The CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected  Bin Laden associates. Tenet spoke to 20 of his foreign counterparts. Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against terrorists in eight countries. In mid-December, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification (MON) giving the CIA broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain  Bin Laden lieutenants, without having to transfer them to U.S. custody.

question is: Passage: "The day was just breaking, as I left the tower; though it was still too dark in the house to be able to see without a light, and I took one of the study candles with me on my 'round.  By the time I had finished the ground floor, the daylight was creeping in, wanly, through the barred windows.  My search had shown me nothing fresh.  Everything appeared to be in order, and I was on the point of extinguishing my candle, when the thought suggested itself to me to have another glance 'round the cellars.  I had not, if I remember rightly, been into them since my hasty search on the evening of the attack.  For, perhaps, the half of a minute, I hesitated.  I would have been very willing to forego the task--as, indeed, I am inclined to think any man well might--for of all the great, awe-inspiring rooms in this house, the cellars are the hugest and weirdest.  Great, gloomy caverns of places, unlit by any ray of daylight.  Yet, I would not shirk the work.  I felt that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice.

question is: Passage: " Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia. He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western "occupation" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off "the head of the snake." By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons. Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates. In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label "al Qaeda operations" too often in these early years. Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections. And in this network,  Bin Laden's agenda stood out. While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya,  Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the "far enemy"-the United States. After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction. In December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, killing two, but no Americans. "

question is: Passage: "What causes a change in motion? The application of a force. Any time an object changes motion, a force has been applied. In what ways can this happen? Force can cause an object at rest to start moving. Forces can cause objects to speed up or slow down. Forces can cause a moving object to stop. Forces can also cause a change in direction. In short, forces cause changes in motion. The moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both. We know that changes in motion require a force. We know that the size of the force determines the change in motion. How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied depends on two things. It depends on the strength of the force. It also depends on the objects mass. Think about some simple tasks you may regularly do. You may pick up a baseball. This requires only a very small force. "
Question0: "Would the mass of a baseball affect how much force you have to use to pick it up?"Choices: A. No B. Yes C. Less the mass, less the force applied D. It depends on the shape of the baseball 
Question1: "What do you apply to an object to make it move or stop?"Choices: A. Strength B. Nothing, it will stop on its own C. Apply force on the ball D. A force E. Pressure 
Question2: "Does an object's mass has very little to do affect how much its motion changes when a force is applied to it?"Choices: A. How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied, has very little to do with the objects mass B. No C. Motion changes only depend on the strength of the force applied D. Yes 
Question3: "What factors cause changes in motion of a moving object?"Choices: A. Shape of the object B. Mass of the object C. The object's mass D. The object's speed, direction, or both speed and direction E. Strength of the force applied F. The application of force G. Who is applying the force

Aleksandr II Nikolaevich; IPA: [aljI'ksandr fta'roj njIka'lajIvjItc]; 29 April [O.S. 17 April] 1818 in Moscow - 13 March [O.S. 1 March] 1881 in Saint Petersburg) was the Emperor of Russia from 2 March 1855 until his assassination in 1881. He was also the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Finland. Alexander was the most successful Russian reformer since Peter the Great. His most important achievement was the emancipation of serfs in 1861, for which he became known as Alexander the Liberator (Russian: Aleksandr Osvoboditel', tr. Aleksandr Osvoboditel; IPA: [aljI'ksandr asv@ba'djitjIlj]). The tsar was responsible for numerous other reforms including reorganizing the judicial system, setting up elected local judges, abolishing capital punishment, promoting local self-government through the zemstvo system, imposing universal military service, ending some of the privileges of the nobility, and promoting the universities. Despite these reforms, during his reign, his brutal secret police, known as the Third Section, sent thousands of dissidents into exile in Siberia. In foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there was another war. He sought peace, moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871, and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. Despite his otherwise pacifistic foreign policy, he fought a brief war with Turkey in 1877-78, pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Although disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Alexander abided by that agreement. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate Constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia. Alexander was proposing additional parliamentary reforms to counter the rise of nascent revolutionary and anarchistic movements when he was assassinated in 1881. "

question is: Passage: "Federal agents on Tuesday raided a South Florida office of Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor whose past issues with authorities had already entangled Sen. Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. "As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time," said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. "While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government," Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez.

question is: Passage: "When the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the pieds-noirs such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pieds-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. From 1955 to 1956, Camus wrote for L'Express. In 1957, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature "for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times". When he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. Camus remained active and ambitious until the end of his life. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyesvsky's Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris. It was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force: 33 actors, 4 hours long, 7 sets, 24 scenes. The walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations. Camus put the painter and set decorator Mayo, who had already illustrated several of Camus' novels (The Stranger - 1948 Ed.), in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets.

question is: Passage: "The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot. It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with a nod, moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her. I marveled at the robot's smoothness and coordination. Clearly, it was a high-end model. Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and pulled me away from the bar for more introductions, with Alexis trailing after us. I spent the evening listening, mostly. Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food provided. No one minded; Sarah's inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter. Ray, a plump man who was grey where he wasn't bald. Zheng, short and dark and lean, with a very intense gaze. He made me a little uncomfortable. Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist. I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the crowd again later. Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so had been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact. After the first half-hour, I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight. I wasn't learning anything useful. I could have started asking questions, but I wanted to get my bearings first. Tonight was for observation. I didn't bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more interesting people, though.

question is: Passage: "Renewable resources can be renewed as they are used. An example is timber, which comes from trees. New trees can be planted to replace those that are cut down. Sunlight is a renewable resource. It seems we will never run out of that! Just because a resource is renewable, it doesnt mean we should use it carelessly. If we  aren't careful, we can pollute resources. Then they may no longer be fit for use. Water is one example. If we pollute a water source it may not be usable for drinking, bathing, or any other type of use. We can also overuse resources that should be renewable. In this case, the resources may not be able to recover. For example, fish are renewable resources. Thats because they can reproduce and make more fish. But water pollution and overfishing can cause them to die out if their population becomes too low. Figure 2.16 shows another example. "

question is: Passage: "During the transition, Bush had chosen John Ashcroft, a former senator from Missouri, as his attorney general. On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI. In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a "steep learning curve," and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation. Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information. The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability. In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism.

question is: Passage: "Durer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominately in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Parmigianino, all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work. His work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the "Little Masters" who attempted few large engravings but continued Durer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. Lucas van Leyden was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of Durer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds (Giulio Campagnola and Christofano Robetta), or whole prints (Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano). However, Durer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also. In painting, Durer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. Durer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the Durer Renaissance of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German nationalism from 1870 to 1945. Durer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by D'Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form. The Lutheran Church remembers Durer as a great Christian annually on April 6, along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Burgkmair. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers him, Cranach and Matthias Grunewald on August 5. "

question is: Passage: "(CNN) -- Air New Zealand's latest in-flight safety video, released Tuesday, is already another viral hit but is encountering some turbulence over its use of several bikini-clad Sports Illustrated models. View the video here Previous versions of the video -- starring anything from Hobbits to Bear Grylls to New Zealand's all conquering All Blacks rugby team -- have revolutionized the on-board safety message airlines deliver to passengers. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling "The world's most beautiful safety video." The "Safety in Paradise" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. It was filmed in the Cook Islands -- home to several stunning beaches -- and coincides with the 50th anniversary of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit franchise. Earlier videos have been witty, clever and quirky but the paradise video combines a far less subtle use of eye-catching material -- using four of the planet's most beautiful, and scantily clad women, to deliver information to passengers. The models include Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Hannah Davis and Jessica Gomes. Christie Brinkley makes a cameo. "It seems that suddenly they are saying that my sexuality is all that matters about me," one critic, Massey University lecturer and feminist commentator Deborah Russell told the Sydney Morning Herald. Social media reaction to the video was predictably mixed, though the majority of commenters on Facebook and Twitter appeared to support the video -- and the women in it. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past.

question is: Passage: "The Earth is tilted 23 1/2 on its axis. This means that as the Earth rotates, one hemisphere has longer days with shorter nights. At the same time the other hemisphere has shorter days and longer nights. For example, in the Northern hemisphere summer begins on June 21. On this date, the North Pole is pointed directly toward the Sun. This is the longest day and shortest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. The South Pole is pointed The hemisphere that is tilted away from the Sun is cooler because it receives fewer direct rays. As Earth orbits the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere goes from winter to spring, then summer and fall. The Southern Hemisphere does the opposite from summer to fall to winter to spring. When it is winter in the Northern hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa. What does this mean for you? If you live in North America, July 1 is usually a very warm day. If you traveled to Southern Australia, you would need a heavy coat. At the equator, the seasons never change. As a result, the average daily temperatures remain the same. There is no summer and winter as we know them. "

question is: Passage: "Her career started more than 20 years ago in a garage behind a Catholic Worker soup kitchen on skid row in Los Angeles. She lived on a $3-a-week stipend that she spent on pantyhose and bus fare. Her law practice grew to an organization that brought in millions of dollars of damages through its cases against L.A. slumlords, allowing poor families to set up college funds and buy homes. In all those years, she never lost a case. When she stepped down, she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law. "I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public-interest lawyers," she said. "It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility. ... The whole system has essentially collapsed." Mintie also started to ask questions about the medical field. Almost every person who walks into a free medical clinic, she said, faces some legal problem such as an eviction or the loss of Social Security benefits. And many of her clients had medical problems from living in slum housing such as cockroaches lodged in ear canals and rat bite fever, a nonfatal malady that particularly affects children. Mintie noticed that health-care professionals were graduating with staggering debts and also couldn't afford to work with the poor. Her work was noticed by Oprah Winfrey, who invited her on the TV show March 26, 2001. Mintie received a $100,000 "Use Your Life Award" from Oprah's Angel Network, a nonprofit organization that awards money to those who help others. Mintie said that all of the money has gone to her recipients -- none was spent on overhead. She will be out of funds by spring. She is trying to get religious organizations to sponsor recipients.

Ross, a veteran Indian fighter, but too old to withstand the hardships of a winter campaign against Indians. The men were all poorly provided with clothing and bedding, most all having taken only what they could strap behind their saddles, but in spite of this and a temperature often below zero, no murmur was heard, and all anxiously, eagerly looked forward to a meeting with the brutal savage murderers of their fellow citizens.

question is: Passage: "Five independent Salt Lake organizations that provide legal services to the poor, ethnic minorities, seniors and people with disabilities have joined together to acquire a west-side downtown building where they will have their offices. The new Community Legal Center at 205 N. 400 West is a project of "And Justice for All," which, until this venture, has been a joint fund-raising campaign by an alliance of the non-profit providers of free legal services. "And Justice for All," which solicits donations primarily from Utah lawyers and foundations, was the first joint fund-raising campaign of legal services agencies in the country, and the Community Legal Center is the first joint office project of public service law groups. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway. It has its own parking, something that's hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients. Owning and sharing the building and not paying rent times five will save the non-profit agencies about $375,000 each year. My assistant, Charity Christenson, pointed out that the shared facility will also be efficient for those needing legal services. No longer will a woman desperate for a protective order, for example, have to run all over town trying to find the right agency. After the tour, we found Jaye Olafson at the cookies and brownies reception on the first floor. Jaye and her husband, Erik, own Tomax Technologies and were the sellers of the building. Jaye explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering what was already there. The hardwood floors, wooden ceilings and brick and stone interior walls were all hidden behind coverings and old paint. She loves the building, and they only moved out because the business had outgrown the space. So they renovated the old Sweet Candy Company building for Tomax. The Olafsons are delighted with the new owners. The building had been like home, she explained, and so it was important who would be living there. "
Question0: "In addition to parking, how else will the new building help the non-profit agencies?"Choices: A. Advertising B. Reduced rent by sharing C. Hardwood floors D. Save them $375,000 each year and be more efficient by having several services in one place E. They can save $375,000 each year by owning and sharing building F. Pristine location G. They can sell new rooms and areas 
Question1: "What two areas of the building will all five agencies be sharing?"Choices: A. The parking lot and bathrooms B. The offices and break rooms C. The reception area and client waiting room D. Kitchen and park 
Question2: "What is the address of the new legal center that five Salt Lake legal organizations have purchased?"Choices: A. 205 north California B. Community Legal Center, West High street C. 405 N. 200 West D. 400 N. 205 West E. 205 W. 400 North F. 205 N. 400 West 
Question3: "Who were the previous owners of the building who moved out due to their business needing more space?"Choices: A. Charity Christenson B. Erik and Christenson C. Jaye and Eric Olafson D. Sweet Candy Company E. Jaye and Erik F. West High 
Question4: "What five groups work under the "And Justice For All" project?"Choices: A. Utah Lawyers Society, Center of Disability, Legal administrations of Utah, Poverty Volunteer Project, and Utah Legal Assistance Program B. Utah lawyers and foundations, was the first joint fund-raising campaign of legal services agencies in the country, and the Community Legal Center is the first joint office project of public service law groups C. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services D.

question is: Passage: "Spain's Golden Age: Under Ferdinand and Isabella, Spain underwent a dramatic transformation. In 1492 the royal pair presided over the final conquest over the Moors and discovery of the New World, including the great wealth that feat brought to Spain.

Ferdinand and Isabella were consummate Spaniards, committed to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their grandson, who assumed the throne in 1516, was born in Flanders in 1500, and Charles I could barely express himself in Spanish.

question is: Passage: "Abrasion is another type of weathering. Like ice wedging, it is a form of mechanical weathering. Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind. It is like sand-blasting a rock. "

question is: Passage: "Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis, he traveled east into the country of the "Independent Thracians"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier. While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight.

question is: Passage: "The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep, ragged cliff of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78–84, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the "Fort of Eidyn," almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital — along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned) — to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005–1034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. "

question is: Passage: "There are more than 30 attorneys in Butler County that volunteer for an organization offering free legal services for low income or elderly households. Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel. Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members. "The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county," said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander. "We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year." LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization. Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging. But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization. Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year. "Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing," said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall. "If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail. But he's entitled to have a public defender ... Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?" LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients. Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters. Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials. "One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield," Alexander said. "There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

question is: Passage: "Historically, LSEO letter-writing campaigns generated from $11,000 to $25,000 annually, recalls Dallas Ferguson, a Tulsa attorney and board president of the new LASO. That amount hardly offset enormous cuts, beginning in 1996, by Congress to Legal Services Corp., the chief funding source for state legal-aid agencies. Threatened with extinction, LSEO clawed its way back with the help of state funding, grant money and the Tulsa Area United Way. Meanwhile, the clients keep coming. At least three-quarters are women and children living in poverty. The agency helps more than 12,000 children a year. A third of LSEO's clients are the working poor who receive no government benefits. Many are senior citizens. Riggs regrets that retired Tulsa attorney John Athens, a champion of legal aid, did not live to see how much the money has meant. Athens died last year. In his honor, The Oxley Foundation donated $200,000 to expand a client hot line. That service, which will be expanded statewide, enables needy people to consult an attorney about civil legal problems, including rent and contract disputes, domestic abuse, consumer issues and custody matters. Attorneys handle no criminal cases. R.H. Harbaugh, foundation trustee and a colleague of Athens at the Conner & Winters law firm, said his mentor had "a special interest in people who could not afford legal services. He was aware of the hot line and supported its expansion." Said Riggs: "We use lofty phrases such as 'with justice for all,' when we talk about our legal system. That phrase is etched on our U.S. Supreme Court building. Those are just empty words if people don't have access to that system." "

question is: Passage: "(CNN) -- Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami-Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as "The Milk Man," of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. "Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings," federal prosecutors said in a statement.

question is: Passage: "Maximilian's death came at a time when Durer was concerned he was losing "my sight and freedom of hand" (perhaps caused by arthritis) and increasingly affected by the writings of Martin Luther. In July 1520 Durer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, Charles V, who was to be crowned at Aachen. Durer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silverpoint, chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of Stefan Lochner), Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Bruges (where he saw Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges), Ghent (where he admired van Eyck's altarpiece), and Zeeland. Durer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much. This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time. Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented. While providing valuable documentary evidence, Durer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, Durer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, Margaret of Austria, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met Bernard van Orley, Jan Provoost, Gerard Horenbout, Jean Mone, Joachim Patinir and Tommaso Vincidor, though he did not, it seems, meet Quentin Matsys. At the request of Christian II of Denmark, Durer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait. There he saw "The things which have been sent to the king from the golden land"--the Aztec treasure that Hernan Cortes had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. Durer wrote that this treasure "was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins". Durer also appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the East Indies. Having secured his pension, Durer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness--perhaps malaria --which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work. "
Question0: "Why was it important that Durer wrote about the price of prints in his diary?"Choices: A. Because there was a large stock of prints B. Because the sales were often noted down at the time C. Because it provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time and at the time, it was very rare for the sales to be documented D. Because the diarys provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time E. It was neede not to forget the values of his prints F. Because this information was rarely documented 
Question1: "What was more beautiful than miracles, according to Durer?"Choices: A. The things which have been sent to the king from the golden land B. 100,000 florins C. The beauty of the queen in the palace D. The Aztec treasure E. Madonna of Bruges 
Question2: "Why did Durer set out on the journey?"Choices: A. To return home B. To renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, Charles V, who was to be crowned at Aachen C. To paint a picture of the king D. To renew the imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, E. To provide rare information

question is: Passage: "Women and minorities appear to be benefiting from greater employment opportunities in the United States, but discrimination remains a significant problem, according to a study to be released today by two professors at the Rutgers School of Law in Newark. The study, which extrapolated from federal data on about 200,000 large and midsize employers, concludes that about two million workers were affected by intentional discrimination in 1999. Roughly a third of the employers studied appeared to have discriminated against women or minorities in at least one job category, the authors said The study was based on information collected from employers by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1990 through 1999 on so-called EEO-1 forms. The husband-and-wife team of Alfred W. and Ruth G. Blumrosen then looked at how many women or minority workers a company employed in different job categories compared with how many were employed at other companies in the same industry in the same geographic area. They described a company as an intentional discriminator if its employment of women or minorities was at least two standard deviations from the average. Legally, companies are presumed to discriminate if their employment numbers are far below the norm. About 22,000 employers were identified as "hard core" discriminators. These companies employed below-average numbers of women and minorities for 10 years and their hiring of women or minorities was so far below the averages that there was only one chance in a hundred that the discrimination occurred randomly. The study also found rising employment for women and minorities, suggesting significant progress in the workplace. The names of the companies are confidential and were not known to the researchers. The professors expect to make their study available through a Web site, www.eeo1.com. The Blumrosens, who were instrumental in setting up the E.E.O.C. in 1965, also say the government should make more active use of their data. The commission said it did not comment on draft reports. "
